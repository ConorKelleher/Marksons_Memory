First task - Get a plaintext, processable copy of Wittgenstein’s Mistress

This is proving harder than originally thought. There doesn’t appear to be such a copy available online. Various websites advertise an ePub version of the book but they are all scam websites, requiring a text-based subscription before allowing access.

A pdf of the book is available at https://www.scribd.com/doc/97355891/Markson-David-Wittgenstein-s-Mistress

This pdf does not contain text files. It contains images. Scans of a physical copy of the book. My options remain as followed:
	1). Find software capable of processing these images and converting 
	    them to plaintext.
	2). Manually type every letter of the book.
Hopefully option 1 pans out.

I have found software at http://www.convertimagetotext.net/downloadsoftware.php capable of converting images of text to text. The free trial of the software only permits 2 pages to be processed at a time however.
I will need to separate the 244-page pdf into 244 individual jpgs. I have found software capable of separating a pdf into individual jpegs at http://pdftoimage.com/

I now have 244 individual text files. They do not have appropriate formatting, however. I will need to first combine them all into a single text file, then go through them formatting them appropriately, as part of this study involves analysing paragraphs as a single unit, so this format must be preserved in the file to be processed

I’m going through it page by page, ensuring the correct format persists for the purpose of processing it. There are certain issues with the auto-text generation. For instance, certain instances of the character “I” were printed as “!”. Also some marks on the pages were converted to non-alphabetic characters such as an “o” coming out as the infinity symbol. I will have to create a program to process the finished work when I am done, identifying certain things.

I’ll have to search for instances of “!” and see if they should be there.

I’ll have to search for times when a full stop is not proceeded by a newline character (or a space, then a newline character). This will occur for things like St. Something (valid), when the character has been parsed mistakenly (invalid) and when I have missed a new sentence and it must be moved to a new line (invalid)

I’ll have to search for characters other than letters and typical punctuation, as these should most likely not be in the text whatsoever.

I’ll have to search for a new line beginning with a lowercase letter.

I’ll have to ensure that every line ends with a full stop

Bralun keeps appearing instead of Brahm. Search for that.

Also be sure to spellcheck everything.
Track all names and identify misspellings among them. - word spellcheck
