33,Was it really some other person I was so anxious to discover when I did all of that looking or was it only my own solitude that I could not abide ?,408,2121
30,Although doubtless when I say they are half empty I should really be saying they are half filled since presumably they were totally empty before somebody half filled them,810,2567
29,Still I find it extraordinary that young men died there in a war that long ago and then died in the same place three thousand years after that,28,894
27,Even if a part I have always liked is when Orestes finally comes back after so many years and Electra does not recognize her own brother,686,2953
27,Then again it is not impossible that they were once filled completely becoming half empty only when somebody removed half of the books to the basement,811,2568
25,so that I do not have to go and fight over Helen of Troy That hardly being the manner in which one imagines that,3045,3046
24,that one of the children to whom Brahms now and again gave some of that candy might very well have been Ludwig Wittgenstein,2679,2680
22,These beach houses are all wood of course All I could do was sit at the dunes and watch it burn,61,860
22,One moment I had been halfway up the stairs and a moment after that I was making believe I was Icarus,738,2873
22,Although doubtless I had been feeling out of sorts for some days which I would have invariably laid to other causes,752,2878
22,to see who would pay tariff to whom so as to be able to make use of a channel of water,892,3065
22,that Brahms was known for carrying candy in his pocket to give to children when he visited people who had children,2678,2682
21,Forgetting for the same instant that I was carrying forty-five square feet of canvas on stretchers up a stone stairway,749,2876
20,High high against the clouds little more than a speck but then swooping in the direction of the sea,378,3037
20,if I have concluded that there is nothing in the painting except shapes am I also concluding that there,845,877
20,can not remember what I had been trying to get that monstrosity of a canvas up that stairway for,984,2941
20,Should anybody else have looked where my signature would have been was under the other person 's image however,1026,2450
19,able to see then is like that nine-foot canvas of mine with its opaque four white coats of,518,681
19,Skittering from one end of the main floor to the other in fact when the mood took me,759,2971
18,Mornings when the leaves are dewy some of them are like jewels where the earliest sunlight glistens,328,2007
18,Before I ever saw one I would have supposed that castles in Spain was just a phrase,431,2120
18,For the life of me I can not remember what I had been trying to get that,764,984,2045
18,I find this second possibility less likely than the first although it is not utterly beyond consideration,812,2569
18,Oh dear the wind has just broken one of the windows in one of the rooms downstairs,971,2862
17,small Like little more than your ordinary city block and a few stories in height practically,16,1984
17,that one can now kneel and drink from the Loire or the Po or the Mississippi,230,1191
17,You will never know how much it has meant to me that you are an artist,462,3590
17,What do you want strange man ? I believe this is what Electra says to him,687,2954
17,There is always something pleasurable about changing into garments that are still warm from the sun,1317,2466
17,even if I have no idea what I have been saying that has now made me,1556,2929
17,I have no idea what I have been saying that has now made me think about,1556,2634,3426
17,For some curious reason one 's meaning would generally appear to be understood in such cases,2806,3666
17,Now how could anybody be so foolish as to name a cat after a dog ?,3195,3209
16,reminds me of something even though I can not remember what it reminds me of,82,1285
16,I suspect that I may have neglected to run the battery for some time now,223,1185
16,I am quite certain so beautiful in the afternoon sun that had touched a chord,692,2958
16,Doubtless my ankle was only sprained Though it was swollen to twice its normal size,943,2046
16,the toilet on the second floor of the house that I burned to the ground,1239,1239
15,When I say not speaking one word I mean not reading one either obviously,161,621
15,Well I knew a great deal about many painters for the same reason that,252,1932
15,And naturally all of this had occurred with what seemed no warning whatsoever either,751,2877
15,Well or in what looked like Greek although I was actually only inventing that,872,3043
14,that I remained in New York for at least two winters before I,195,3515
14,As many cans as there must have been Romans watching the Christians practically,364,2287
14,Brunelleschi returned home to Florence and put up the largest dome since antiquity,498,3688
14,it has been carried all of the way across the ocean by now,617,865
14,In spite of frequently underlining sentences in books that had not been assigned,626,1539
14,an explanation for why so many of the books in the house are,813,2570
14,And what have I been saying that has now made me think about,945,986
14,so that he can listen to the Sirens singing but will stay put,1284,2982
14,a history of music written for children and printed in extraordinarily large type,1800,1946
14,the question as to which life of Brahms it was that I read,1945,1959
14,been locked up in a loft in SoHo for all of its life,2103,3502
14,that nobody ever pays attention to a word Cassandra says in the opera,2304,2314
14,Which is to say that even though I happen to be thinking about,3262,3330
14,I have taken to building fires down near the water after my sunsets,3781,3782
13,nine-foot canvas of mine with its opaque four white coats of gesso,518,3678
13,Still how I nearly felt In the midst of all that looking,644,2948
13,back into the room with the atlas and the life of Brahms,661,841
13,a guide to the birds of Southern Connecticut and Long Island Sound,708,1687
13,The next morning it was swollen to twice its normal size nonetheless,737,2872
13,This would have been right after I had heard the glass naturally,972,2863
13,about inconsequential perplexities now and again becoming the fundamental mood of existence,1361,3393
13,I have not given that a thought for a week or more,2382,2383
13,when I brought up St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross,2487,2488
13,This is not really that complicated although it may seem to be,2491,3263
12,for a while that the Greek ships were beached there still,22,1981
12,a page torn out of an atlas instead of maritime charts,30,3090
12,For the life of me I have no idea why I,144,3722
12,are not the same museum even though they are both in,249,250
12,Directly above and to the side of where this typewriter is,464,3740
12,I am still feeling the typewriter naturally And hearing the keys,673,3027
12,convinced that I have never read a single word written by,799,1124
12,which is to say that the stick was already not lost,881,2900
12,for the life of me I can not remember having put,969,2115
12,seagull which came to his window each morning to be fed,1310,2747
12,a nice present but you do need a lot of time,1549,2683
12,Well and I certainly would have found it agreeable to tell,1555,1734,3393
12,about not letting a single person ever see him at work,1719,2058
12,Hm I would seem to have left something out just then,1851,3028
12,was born fifteen years before Rupert Brooke and was still alive,1998,2326
12,were aware that there had been a painter named Taddeo Gaddi,2275,2278
12,there is no painting by Van Gogh called The Broken Bottles,2423,2424
12,if my roses will still be red after it gets dark,2431,2432
12,When one says that one does not read one word of,2709,2709
12,Lawrence of Arabia did not look very much like Peter O'Toole,2775,2778
12,the day after the day after I went to the basement,2856,2857
12,the road to the house in the woods behind this house,3328,3328
12,Even if for the life of me I have no idea,3426,3722
12,think of my cat 's name in a day or two,3445,3453
11,Well it would have been a harmless enough thing to,23,1983
11,even if there is not remarkably much left of it,64,1011
11,I am saying so only in a manner of speaking,126,3478
11,Such as the birthdays of people like Pablo Picasso or,129,1117
11,so that they would not make him go to fight,243,1269,1460
11,while I was peeing I thought about Lawrence of Arabia,264,2769
11,Any number of habits died hard that way For some,295,1241
11,Poor Electra To wish to murder one 's own mother,312,2963
11,I happen to believe the story about Giotto and the,509,2176
11,both printed on cheap paper and both ruined by dampness,532,664
11,or El Greco being the sort of thing that one,554,556
11,the opera that I am thinking about now I suspect,688,2955
11,What do any of us ever truly know however ?,734,1505,1601,3577
11,In either event the present state of the shelves is,813,2570
11,right past St. Petersburg without knowing it was St. Petersburg,847,1680
11,what I was talking about when I was talking about,895,896
11,in one of the women 's rooms with a lipstick,1024,2448
11,What I was signing was an image of myself naturally,1025,2449
11,The slides that I took of my mother and father,1063,1065
11,naturally remains exactly where it had been all the while,1388,1389
11,there is no life of Brahms in the other house,1431,1471
11,head sometimes manages to jump about the way it does,1458,2646
11,they were not always aware of it was the way,1583,2182
11,I was one hundred percent positive that I was in,1694,1697
11,The Descent from the Cross by Rogier van der Weyden,1810,1835,3667
11,took away the tiny pocket sort of mirror from beside,1866,3560
11,would have found it agreeable to have been descended from,2178,2179
11,an occasion when Lucien brought William Gaddis to my loft,2262,2263
11,russet is not a name one gives to a color,2329,3180
11,Downstairs they go every last one of the troublesome things,2826,2839
11,the cat which scratches at the outside of my window,3400,3446
11,say when we put the cat out for the night,3496,3507
10,fill up with snow which must surely be rare,68,496,1136,1614
10,had himself lashed to the mast of a ship,79,2981
10,ten years for the war and still another ten,242,1278
10,For some reason a part I always liked was,243,1269
10,I once knew a great deal about many painters,251,1931
10,broken window in the room next to this one,327,950
10,behind my back since most of the cans had,366,927
10,mirror that had been beside my mother 's bed,546,1303
10,Surely it would have been easy to lose track,558,2152
10,ate his lunch every day at the Eiffel Tower,602,605
10,who is to argue that it might not have,618,1520
10,naturally I would have had no way of knowing,648,2119
10,never knowing just whom one might find as well,704,2950
10,Not until dusk did I emerge from the cul-de-sac,705,2959
10,or whoosh ! and here we go round the,760,2972
10,Many of the shelves up here are half empty,809,2566
10,There is nobody at the window in the painting,824,1421
10,I have very little idea what I mean by,836,882
10,at the window in the painting of this house,896,953
10,Though in fact the name I put down was,1028,2457
10,having taken up a board from the bathroom floor,1243,1244
10,The reverse of that statement being equally true obviously,1261,1664
10,Although very likely it was hardly that simple either,1325,1352
10,Sculpture is the art of taking away superfluous material,1330,2027
10,One has a fairly acute inkling as to when,1491,1570
10,I am by no means implying that there is,1499,1588
10,You do not need a lot of money to,1549,2683
10,Possibly I did not need to make that explanation,1874,2016
10,that the young woman is asleep in the Metropolitan,1876,1884
10,started to cry because somebody was hitting a horse,1896,3659
10,Although what I do only this instant realize is,2205,3421
10,that St. John of the Cross would have been,2505,3413
10,that I could have written this many pages without,2513,3321
10,look at the eight or nine cartons of books,2561,2576
10,reading the backs of the jackets on phonograph records,2662,2663
10,on when he went for walks in the woods,2693,3440
10,the back of the jacket on Thus Spake Zarathustra,2720,2722
10,the back of the jacket on The Alto Rhapsody,2721,2722
10,when one merely looks at it on the page,2760,2761
10,was dressed in the film about Lawrence of Arabia,2776,2782
10,sane and free from anxiety than by being mad,3024,3656
10,Even if there would appear to be no record,3035,3690
10,there would appear to be no record as to,3035,3196,3440
10,began to have thoughts along those lines as well,3280,3281
10,say when I found the cat waiting for breakfast,3495,3506
10,able to decide upon a name for a cat,3531,3531
9,the Hellespont By which I mean the Dardanelles,29,1585,3715
9,from which I watch the sun go down,133,1365
9,have been what put me in mind of,149,150
9,must surely have known a great deal about,252,1932
9,it was a woman who wrote the Odyssey,293,1841
9,I was about to add that this was,298,1463
9,Wrist deep in it the lot of them,313,2964
9,was able to maneuver directly up the hillside,390,3510
9,There are no painting materials in this house,463,576
9,the other house farther down the beach which,528,656
9,To the castle a sign must have said,549,1467,3802
9,there is nobody at the window in the,587,824,1421
9,he did not have to look at it,603,605
9,I do not believe I have ever mentioned,630,1367
9,in any of the plays about anybody menstruating,725,1489
9,the way in which I was standing naturally,748,2875
9,convinced that there is somebody at the window,831,833
9,As a matter of fact I have now,842,2357
9,gold coins on the floor of his studio,889,3186
9,coins on the floor of Rembrandt 's studio,952,2335
9,of the rooms here that I do not,998,3744
9,Or soon I will be coming to the,1012,1239
9,I suspect there is something ironical in my,1065,1124,3487
9,about anxiety being the fundamental mood of existence,1122,2694
9,a street called Maiden Lane near Covent Garden,1136,2065
9,The world is everything that is the case,1215,1221,1227
9,toilet fastened to pipes on the second floor,1237,2968
9,what I am now thinking about is the,1284,2323
9,would hide under a table when there was,1343,2057
9,Although when one comes right down to it,1490,1954
9,but was thinking there is my house ?,1536,3326
9,One of the things people generally admired about,1583,2182
9,As a matter of fact I have no,1648,2577
9,in the vehicle which went over the embankment,1648,1649
9,asleep at a table in the Metropolitan Museum,1815,1817
9,be hearing a different piece of music entirely,1872,1873
9,that when one comes right down to it,2030,3069
9,the cat that scratches at my broken window,2184,2359
9,the Piero who did not hide under tables,2197,2299
9,I was extremely sorry to hear about your,2255,2255
9,the cat I saw in the Colosseum and,2286,3400
9,Willem de Kooning was not descended from anybody,2301,2303
9,a painting of a fire which is not,2428,3449
9,something I did not remember I remembered until,2489,2490
9,to look at the eight or nine cartons,2561,2575
9,I could not make sense out of the,2712,2781
9,my including the back of the jacket on,2722,2722
9,the first book to have been put into,2812,2813
9,Now heavens how weary I have gotten of,2824,2825
9,Even if what this next reminds me of,2831,2934
9,if the carton had not had a label,2987,2988
9,returns to Ithaca after having been gone for,3138,3192
9,I might have thought about writing to then,3262,3330
9,having been contrived in a spirit of fun,3271,3299
9,ask me what my almost cat 's name,3284,3294
9,instances lately when I have spoken about my,3331,3424
8,As a matter of fact it was,21,384,3062,3670
8,Perhaps I am no more than forty-seven,46,278
8,I may have made an error earlier,73,1585
8,One 's language is frequently imprecise in,81,1253
8,in a manner of speaking of course,126,566
8,I might still recite if I wished,129,1117
8,the way it wants to be seen,182,1832
8,As a matter of fact I now,199,3328

8,with such industry that people believed they,497,3687
8,seem to decide on a name for,515,2129
8,write a strange calligraphy against the whiteness,517,2044
8,to see if the breeze might make,521,3765
8,As a matter of fact one could,527,596
8,As a matter of fact I did,529,2003
8,when one stops to think about it,557,2146
8,As a matter of fact it is,581,2841,3745
8,I believed I saw somebody at a,593,631

8,that the life of Lawrence of Arabia,2811,2922
8,of having a house full of books,2838,2838
8,if I have not made that clear,3008,3332
8,that there is no better way of,3024,3656
8,grass that is not real is real,3032,3032
8,one thousand one hundred and eighty-six ships,3048,3050
8,But be all that as it may,3082,3252
8,as a matter of fact what I,3105,3115,3726
8,this whole thing still one more time,3242,3243
8,been considered more famous than Martin Heidegger,3246,3247
8,in the eyes of people who admired,3249,3250
8,And as a matter of fact I,3253,3328
8,now and again whether I have mentioned,3322,3340
8,that every single time I have mentioned,3343,3344
8,what I ought to have mentioned was,3343,3344
8,on his way to becoming a stranger,3519,3521
8,one can be as alone as when,3648,3649
8,explanation for not having written anything in,3723,3726
7,I have no idea how long,5,1059
7,But be that as it may,29,1157,1884,2166,3156,3503
7,took me only two unhurried days,30,3090
7,I was mad when I drove,36,153
7,I burned to the ground I,60,1012
7,well come to think about it,65,1855
7,with a right-hand drive and watching,68,1614
7,which came rolling down a hill,69,1133
7,I am quite certain that I,75,427
7,hundreds and hundreds of tennis balls,87,3638
7,watchfires being lighted along the shore,94,1982
7,to do that sort of thing,101,3291
7,as long ago as when I,102,1114
7,for instance which I am convinced,129,1117
7,from all of those years ago,130,1354
7,no more than three or four,131,321
7,In a manner of speaking one,142,843,1054,2014,3593
7,I am less than positive that,147,3729
7,It did run on that madness,151,2967
7,does not have to be mad,152,3516
7,keeping a weather eye out for,158,1293
7,not speaking one word of Russian,160,2475
7,say that I was looking for,170,171
7,startled me and how I felt,192,1135
7,is here it will be here,213,1115
7,I no longer have any idea,225,3287
7,idea who she may have been,225,1118
7,To tell the truth I would,226,1114
7,All I can remember about the,253,1967
7,that Helen was the cause of,256,890
7,Helen has a splendid radiant dignity,262,1277
7,a pee and Lawrence of Arabia,266,2770
7,I may or may not have,272,3756
7,I have no idea any longer,282,2820
7,To tell the truth it was,304,495
7,the central staircase in the Metropolitan,304,735
7,making use of all sorts of,308,3511
7,I did not think about it,311,1219
7,was an effective Helen in The,315,1447
7,that I watched a certain few,316,1452
7,I have a vague recollection that,321,1427
7,I am fairly certain that I,331,1925
7,if that is at all relevant,331,1330
7,To tell the truth I did,354,1547
7,no way of telling if the,366,1428
7,now that I think about it,371,769,1206,1254,1333,1415,1666,2818
7,which brought me to this beach,377,384
7,when I thought I saw the,379,380
7,I thought I saw the cat,379,379
7,As a matter of fact the,400,436,892,1635,2453,3229
7,The cat at the Colosseum was,402,513
7,I thought about them like that,410,411
7,In a manner of speaking I,411,3346,3572
7,about wandering through an endless nothingness,413,798,1624
7,Generally even then I was lonely,416,3801
7,that the castle was built on,429,429
7,on the inside of the roof,445,1645
7,the rubber mat from the floor,445,1637
7,As a matter of fact what,452,980,2420,3105,3115,3726
7,I have no recollection whatsoever of,457,3757
7,When one comes down to it,459,1086,1258,2828,3191
7,A painting of this very house,465,3741
7,'s name that caught my eye,495,1121
7,built the beautiful campanile next door,500,3689
7,it is not impossible that people,507,640
7,Andrea del Sarto or Taddeo Gaddi,507,888
7,down to the water 's edge,517,3677
7,been printed on extraordinarily cheap paper,523,3768
7,which I burned to the ground,528,1009
7,under the influence of William Shakespeare,538,1569
7,positive of a life after death,540,2636
7,that it was a life of,544,2773
7,As a matter of fact there,561,786,1654,2481
7,there would have had to be,577,1144
7,the taverns from which one could,600,600
7,one allows one 's self to,610,948
7,being sold in the shops for,628,883
7,I saw somebody at a window,631,641
7,a shop selling artists ' supplies,642,2947
7,Though as a matter of fact,645,660,1334,2481
7,All of the books in the,647,2582
7,had been under the influence of,649,1569
7,the painting is on the wall,660,662
7,the life of Brahms that I,663,1434
7,One might as well ask if,671,1423
7,what exactly was I hearing ?,677,839
7,and in any manner one wished,683,3679
7,from where all arts and all,693,1740
7,may not have been broken but,736,2871
7,I believe I have mentioned having,757,2777
7,stairway for on the other hand,764,2941
7,There would appear to be no,770,1484,2242,3035,3196,3440,3690
7,the Four Serious Songs by Brahms,771,1791
7,in the basement of this house,786,3380
7,cartons of books in the basement,788,2578
7,at the rear of the house,791,2557
7,if I have not indicated that,792,1164
7,yesterday or the day before yesterday,798,802
7,did not make any sort of,803,2985
7,the books in the basement are,808,822
7,Baseball When the Grass Was Real,814,1472
7,I am in no way certain,853,2778
7,night that my rowboat disappeared as,862,1249
7,Somebody is living on this beach,874,3803
7,even if I can not remember,888,1273
7,without so much as a glance,900,3186
7,As a matter of fact even,909,1688,1903,3186
7,in the sand With a stick,909,2317
7,had no way of knowing if,927,2119
7,I started to type that sentence,947,2281
7,Which is to say that I,951,1243,1360,3684
7,fact I am next to positive,975,3026
7,I am next to positive that,975,2264,3228
7,in no way connected to the,977,1613
7,The tape deck in the van,978,1631
7,Though to tell the truth I,982,1114
7,to tell the truth I had,982,1770,3264
7,book about art in this house,995,2836
7,There is the house that I,1012,1233
7,Which is to say that it,1036,1683,3321
7,is the sort of thing that,1037,3760
7,a painting of a Passover meal,1056,1075
7,one of them was in a,1068,2598
7,I decided to take a walk,1071,1416
7,And to tell the truth I,1086,1547,2553,2609,2962,3264
7,to tell the truth I have,1086,2560
7,I came back from the town,1098,1099
7,There is an explanation for the,1129,2393
7,I read the life of Brahms,1131,1132
7,it is quite possible that I,1147,2539
7,make a major project out of,1199,1381
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned how,1200,1643
7,now and again I will be,1201,1809
7,the house that I am dismantling,1207,1230
7,no more than one of semantics,1212,3735
7,become the fundamental mood of existence,1226,2744
7,I knocked over the kerosene lamp,1237,2968
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned having,1244,2541,3021
7,I find it interesting that I,1258,1288
7,my laundry which is spread across,1301,3795
7,for a certain period near water,1310,1312
7,to be a road leading to,1371,1379
7,I was not able to locate,1372,1380
7,is a thing one might do,1403,1405
7,see this house from that one,1406,1415
7,that I have more than once,1439,2479
7,there is an explanation for my,1482,3030
7,explanation for my generally speaking of,1482,1625
7,the two dots over Bronte however,1484,1626
7,what with the considerable likelihood that,1501,1976
7,never even once had a lover,1501,1976
7,I believe I would have liked,1554,1733,2756
7,about The Way of All Flesh,1578,1843
7,of Achilles hiding among the women,1581,2405
7,of The Way of All Flesh,1603,1840,2611
7,I have only at this instant,1610,3334
7,listen to Maria Callas singing Medea,1630,1670
7,Which is to say that perhaps,1640,3074
7,had nothing to do with that,1688,3241
7,a pharmacy or a movie theater,1690,1695
7,numeral on the back of the,1691,3778
7,Do n't bother to get up,1735,2063,2914
7,I have no way of telling,1744,2363
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned the,1752,2523
7,the Four Last Songs by Strauss,1783,3419
7,number of times in these pages,1794,1795
7,I had not been thinking about,1813,1822
7,The young woman is asleep in,1818,1876,1884
7,all I had started to say,1822,2426
7,painting by Rogier van der Weyden,1824,1885
7,I am able to state categorically,1832,2475
7,have no idea why I have,1847,2642
7,Oh All I had meant to,1852,3029
7,that I was not able to,1883,2711
7,When Friedrich Nietzsche was mad he,1896,3659
7,soccer shirt with the name Savona,1905,3752
7,wish to pursue such a question,1905,1906
7,What I find interesting about this,1911,2708
7,I have in mind is that,1937,2472
7,a wreath at Achilles 's grave,1991,1995
7,I have not mentioned having been,1999,2541
7,meantime I would appear to have,2002,2126
7,it is not one hundred percent,2030,2319
7,If one squints just a little,2031,2417
7,did not care very much for,2050,2051
7,all it actually means is that,2071,2492
7,seagulls at the garbage disposal area,2091,3407
7,Once when I was painting in,2099,3500
7,I was feeling quite guilty about,2102,2107
7,to let the cat back in,2107,2134
7,argue that he might not have,2150,2336
7,to suggest that Willem de Kooning,2215,2339
7,Willem de Kooning could have been,2215,3596
7,would not have been able to,2222,2708
7,On the other hand it is,2251,3066
7,climbed into William Gaddis 's lap,2262,2282
7,One is made to think about,2266,2266
7,wrote a novel called The Recognitions,2273,3075
7,an alarm clock around his neck,2274,3075
7,would not have been aware of,2276,3210
7,when he himself was a pupil,2330,2331
7,This is scarcely to suggest that,2335,2339,2770
7,it was Willem de Kooning who,2335,3181
7,come to think about it since,2378,3044
7,the painting of this very house,2381,3740
7,and to which the door is,2383,3744
7,fire but is only a reflection,2428,3449
7,one did not remember one remembered,2481,2492
7,the pain in my left shoulder,2522,2523
7,I was downstairs in the basement,2540,2542
7,to go down to the basement,2559,2575
7,So that to tell the truth,2560,3245
7,why I went down there yesterday,2560,2847
7,books in the one carton I,2584,2842
7,book from the carton that I,2606,2771
7,of the books from the carton,2610,2704
7,book called The Way of All,2616,2616
7,called The Way of All Meat,2616,2825
7,that as a matter of fact,2623,3105
7,by Marco Antonio Montes de Oca,2624,2651
7,when one says it out loud,2625,2760
7,I would have been thinking about,2633,3262
7,By which I mean that if,2684,3292
7,that I was able to recognize,2706,2771
7,a life of Lawrence of Arabia,2771,2773,2773,2784
7,just as many books about art,2838,2840
7,least as I started to say,2880,3578
7,must have had more important things,2994,2995
7,once underlined a sentence by Michelangelo,3021,3022
7,I am next to positive I,3026,3339
7,that Electra and Orestes would have,3098,3101
7,she would have immediately understood that,3108,3109
7,when I say house I should,3110,3128
7,Which is to say that doubtless,3165,3187
7,I have just been talking about,3191,3350
7,I can no longer be certain,3256,3257
7,it may have been William Gaddis,3287,3355
7,I have thought about Magritte practically,3323,3341
7,lost track of where I was,3352,3353
7,I should really be saying wrote,3370,3610
7,and there is the cat which,3400,3401
7,Which is not to say that,3411,3456
7,doing was lying in the sun,3458,3580
7,one 's husband had become drunk,3544,3544
7,that one can just as easily,3650,3651
7,there is practically no place in,3692,3693
7,from which one can not see,3692,3693
7,if there had not been any,3764,3765
6,Somebody is living in the,1,2
6,when I was doing that,5,3486
6,I suspect I may have,9,370,3255
6,Time out of mind meaning,10,10,40
6,the name of the river,13,92
6,to do next was to,24,1141
6,that as it may I,29,3252
6,Burning artifacts and picture frames,33,1263
6,of one 's only child,40,3516
6,There is only one mirror,43,1029
6,But I do not even,46,2381
6,when it was that I,46,190
6,when I was at the,49,1119
6,fire I had at the,51,83
6,still prone to think of,64,1011
6,my old loft in SoHo,66,2965
6,I have lost track of,67,1924
6,There was an explanation for,70,428,3189
6,hill with nobody driving it,70,3651
6,And in either case I,73,1096
6,an explanation for this too,76,3189
6,I am quite certain I,85,1287
6,Rogier van der Weyden The,85,182
6,the Spanish Steps in Rome,87,355
6,I am talking about And,114,2111,3740
6,of the ancient Greek plays,140,527
6,manner of speaking one might,142,143
6,doubtless I would not have,145,146,1027,1091,1760,2281,3073
6,I would not have been,145,2708
6,that those last two sentences,147,2884
6,when I went to Mexico,152,172
6,the grave of one 's,152,3516
6,I do not have any,162,968,2354
6,to all of those other,176,3312
6,I am not certain whether,179,2374
6,that I am speaking about,181,377,2746
6,that Rogier van der Weyden,182,2177
6,Through all of that time,194,1532,3379
6,I am almost certain that,195,559
6,of my path to the,214,1192
6,I rarely make use of,218,787
6,The houses along this beach,221,1008
6,I would like to inform,230,1191
6,the last four digits of,234,1354
6,I would have had to,236,1649,1813
6,I have no recollection of,237,1648
6,Would n't she have ?,242,3085
6,Achilles dressing like a girl,243,292
6,remain in one 's head,248,2580
6,I harbor sincere doubts that,255,1556
6,A single Spartan girl as,257,3055
6,when I read the plays,263,542
6,Meanwhile I have just been,264,2768
6,I can think of no,266,735
6,of Lawrence of Arabia at,269,2773
6,the name T. E. Shaw,270,2790
6,is one more of those,270,2250
6,In the house where I,286,2968
6,daughter to raise wind for,291,3086
6,turning my shoes upside down,294,3524
6,Needing some assistance But nonetheless,299,3084
6,The Trojan Women by Euripides,315,2600
6,The Recognitions by William Gaddis,335,335,1440,1440
6,appeared to be the case,345,3251
6,divested myself of the watches,347,1257
6,getting rid of the watches,356,356
6,When I say that I,357,524
6,I had no way of,366,927
6,I do not mean only,381,1561
6,may as well stop looking,386,3641
6,Have I mentioned looking in,387,1294,3039
6,the seat of this chair,406,674
6,since the last time I,422,3139
6,The explanation being that the,429,3190
6,that I am talking about,434,2870,3740
6,Perhaps there is no connection,439,506
6,all of this time I,444,3744
6,fallen on top of me,445,1637
6,I have just said it,451,2779
6,Even if I have no,457,1556,1744,2929,3003,3444,3755
6,a painting of this house,468,530,655
6,None of this is counting,475,2670
6,the painting of the house,478,529,824,997
6,in the window of a,494,2947
6,Well the point being that,502,603
6,for all that I was,514,1381,1622
6,was a life of Brahms,523,544,1434
6,a life of Brahms which,523,1796
6,is a painting of this,530,3741
6,Unless of course there were,532,2097
6,of Brahms in this house,532,3769
6,One does not name a,537,2186
6,occurred to me that the,541,2389
6,the fact that I was,542,1895
6,at the time when I,542,2488
6,Conversely I have no idea,544,2192
6,even if it happens that,552,1511
6,who is to say that,558,1954
6,fairly abstract at that point,563,3743
6,in my head as well,567,2382
6,For that matter I have,569,1440,2634
6,of my own such as,572,834
6,changes anything in the painting,572,834
6,the door to the deck,573,574
6,that perhaps she had been,585,1640
6,at the dunes the painter,588,675
6,a street full of taverns,597,2946
6,place in Paris from which,603,3693
6,also happen to know that,604,2074
6,not wish to look at,605,3694
6,frequently imprecise in such ways,606,1253
6,Sometimes I like to believe,617,865
6,As far as to the,617,866,2005
6,One would certainly wish to,622,2994
6,I did well in college,626,1539
6,in any of these pages,630,1288
6,somebody at a window in,631,1421
6,one is apt to visualize,634,635
6,that the painting is not,655,2427
6,certain that the painting is,660,1273
6,And at least we have,663,1945
6,set fire to the pages,663,1845
6,on those forty-five square feet,685,2951
6,And here of all places,691,2957
6,It was only the Parthenon,692,1685
6,no less from where all,693,2960
6,Still for a time I,694,1686
6,which was actually a cul-de-sac,699,2946
6,against a small stretched canvas,706,2947
6,To tell the truth one,707,779
6,a Volkswagen van filled with,709,1630
6,There is naturally nothing in,725,1489
6,I had been doing was,739,3580
6,a wind which caused that,742,2874
6,broken windows in the museum,742,2874
6,And I do not even,746,1443
6,a tape deck in the,769,977
6,In either event it was,773,2728,2897
6,set to the on position,774,1615,1784,2671
6,'s name by the way,785,1286,3188
6,that came into my head,798,1822
6,would appear to have been,823,1476,2460,3139
6,I have put that badly,832,2306
6,to say was that I,833,3723
6,it remains a fact that,834,958,3272
6,what I mean by that,836,1438
6,there is no way of,838,925,1428
6,could have driven right past,848,1680
6,have been able to tell,849,2689
6,actually I do not remember,854,1014
6,I do not remember that,854,884
6,Now and again I have,870,1085,1618,2038
6,the cause of that war,890,3054
6,during the first World War,893,1585
6,no matter how many times,902,1380
6,One finds it difficult to,905,1867
6,it difficult to think of,905,1977
6,writing in the sand With,909,3643
6,any number of times in,911,1794,3682
6,which is the one thing,912,2123
6,the end of his life,926,2193
6,agreeable to think of Brahms,935,1965
6,one has no idea how,940,2092
6,one of the popes made,942,2520
6,I began to think about,949,950
6,to be a book about,956,957
6,a book about baseball is,956,1803
6,one is not thinking about,964,964
6,I had been thinking about,967,1303
6,positive that I have never,975,1843
6,on the afternoon when I,976,2946
6,that the life of Brahms,988,1852
6,the life of Brahms was,988,1132,1309
6,is that I would have,990,2558
6,I have now remembered that,1003,1930
6,occurs to me is that,1005,2749
6,to think of it as,1011,3278
6,to the house that I,1012,1195
6,In fact I have no,1018,2479
6,the Borghese Gallery in Rome,1023,1662
6,one mirror in this house,1029,3562
6,to say that it is,1036,1529
6,I did not believe I,1044,2533
6,I would have wished to,1044,1845
6,that The Last Supper was,1054,1056
6,the table beside my bed,1068,2649
6,is a painting of a,1075,3449
6,possibly I have not mentioned,1079,2585,2663,2747,2870
6,in either case I have,1089,2466
6,since one would have surely,1091,2148
6,to make certain that the,1097,1409
6,why I did not remember,1100,1102
6,Doubtless this is only because,1101,3399
6,more of the sound of,1101,3425
6,what I am more truthfully,1104,3153,3785
6,I am convinced that I,1117,1124,3515
6,at least did not come,1119,3704
6,an hour ago when I,1119,1357
6,in some way connected to,1126,2796
6,too tall for the shelves,1130,2834
6,And in either event I,1131,1709
6,on the morning when I,1132,1262
6,almost hit by the car,1132,1133,1134
6,it crashed into something else,1142,1144
6,it on the other hand,1146,1199
6,on the other hand I,1146,1287,2340
6,To this day I have,1151,3219
6,on a morning when I,1151,1682
6,when I happened to be,1151,3764
6,happened to be visiting in,1151,1620
6,I did not see the,1158,1814
6,if I had wished to,1160,2595
6,a life of Brahms in,1169,3769
6,not a life of Brahms,1170,1522
6,I am dismantling a house,1196,1197
6,turning dismantled lumber into firewood,1210,3733
6,After it has been dismantled,1211,3734
6,not too long ago all,1218,1805
6,to myself a hundred times,1220,2688
6,In the meantime I have,1223,3334
6,of a life of Brahms,1223,1845
6,a second copy of the,1225,1435
6,copy of the identical book,1225,1473
6,Even if there is no,1238,2969
6,I now remember that I,1240,1452
6,in this case it is,1243,1923,2414
6,I will not trouble to,1253,3799
6,What happened was that I,1255,3239
6,have had no reason to,1263,1753
6,Although what I am now,1284,2275,2673
6,the scene in which Odysseus,1284,2982
6,For some reason this story,1285,3444
6,Doubtless it would have been,1308,1976,3176
6,from the life of Brahms,1309,2386
6,while I was out there,1317,2892
6,and then one day I,1324,1351
6,moment in the history of,1336,2921
6,in the history of art,1336,1337,2913,2921
6,not to be confused with,1344,2057
6,by the way which was,1344,3188
6,that I had not been,1359,1822
6,when I first came to,1370,2668
6,there has got to be,1379,2816
6,road leading to that house,1379,1382
6,in the pickup truck as,1383,2005
6,either to tell the truth,1393,1920,2942
6,and of change of life,1396,2702
6,I imagine I can understand,1401,1401
6,Although what I was more,1404,1823
6,the person who had translated,1411,2602
6,What happened was that there,1416,3284
6,Then again it is perhaps,1422,1942,2606
6,walked to the other house,1423,1424
6,On the other hand there,1428,2652
6,in the other house is,1433,1610
6,forced to wonder is if,1436,2673
6,the life of Brahms would,1436,1523
6,when I have not seen,1440,1441
6,I do not even know,1443,2381
6,But what I am actually,1445,2836
6,what I am actually now,1445,2261
6,Well which is to say,1449,3608
6,What I would more seriously,1458,2088
6,one of the women pregnant,1465,2326
6,has anything to do with,1471,2138,3457
6,anything to do with the,1471,3474
6,Baseball When the Grass Is,1476,1477
6,would have been more appropriate,1477,1523
6,on the other hand is,1478,2490
6,even if I have forgotten,1513,3420
6,all the way down to,1520,3677
6,if I have not said,1521,3756
6,to be a life of,1525,2771
6,wall in the other house,1526,1535
6,A certain amount of this,1537,3034
6,never read one word of,1543,1544
6,On my honor Wittgenstein once,1550,3001
6,for a name when one,1567,2070
6,I would have sworn I,1575,1824
6,is always touching everybody else,1583,2408
6,Which in either case still,1591,3092
6,is one of the saddest,1597,3427
6,nothing to do with the,1608,2461
6,I have no explanation for,1625,3726
6,of the two dots over,1626,1626
6,upside down in the Mediterranean,1632,1641,1660
6,how wet I had gotten,1642,1643
6,one more thing that I,1645,2009
6,with the name Savona on,1656,1690,1905
6,that I would have been,1659,2558,2606
6,answers the question as to,1677,1841
6,wished to stop at Corinth,1681,1688
6,that I had already been,1681,3682
6,the Tate Gallery in London,1698,3215
6,which finally led me to,1711,2575
6,Euripides was said to have,1720,2438
6,The reason I have not,1753,2383
6,rolled down the Spanish Steps,1758,1759
6,in spite of having been,1768,3091
6,finds it agreeable to be,1776,2830
6,Life of Brahms or The,1796,3750
6,The Life of Brahms or,1796,3750
6,Even if I had not,1813,2630
6,certainly I would have had,1813,2691
6,when I was thinking about,1814,1823,2488
6,that painting by Jan Vermeer,1815,1875
6,Rogier van der Weyden and,1824,1933
6,about Rogier van der Weyden,1832,2177
6,than positive that I have,1843,3729
6,doubtless I would have scarcely,1844,2987
6,The life of Brahms is,1848,1852
6,I had meant to say,1852,2984
6,What I mean is that,1873,2654,3032
6,is now in my head,1875,2382
6,Although what I am more,1876,2894
6,asleep in the Metropolitan Museum,1876,1879
6,now struck me is that,1879,2808
6,it is a fact that,1884,2682
6,be willing to wager that,1905,3618
6,I did not put in,1928,2852
6,there would have been no,1961,3050
6,was one more person who,1975,2642,2736,3010,3713
6,this is only because I,1999,3399
6,equidistant from each other too,2000,2288,2291
6,to the garbage disposal area,2005,2013,3401
6,I have never mentioned before,2009,3339
6,a painting by Van Gogh,2030,2031
6,nine-foot canvas up the main,2045,2870
6,But which in either case,2091,3092
6,New York for a summer,2099,3500
6,as well even though I,2102,2382
6,Even if as I have,2124,3180
6,my russet cat 's name,2126,2132
6,a name for the cat,2128,3493
6,one automatically associates with Rembrandt,2136,3184
6,has something to do with,2138,2468
6,when Willem de Kooning was,2144,2328
6,on the other hand which,2150,3322
6,had been a pupil of,2151,2280,2299,2299
6,been a pupil of Rembrandt,2151,2157,2234
6,all the way back to,2153,2742
6,de Kooning was descended from,2154,2300
6,was a pupil of Rembrandt,2158,2158,2218
6,become equally as famous as,2168,2174
6,Although to tell the truth,2173,2589,3581
6,seem to have anxiety in,2182,2695
6,had to live off charity,2193,2194
6,in the case of Rembrandt,2214,2355
6,would have been less than,2238,3127
6,connection between Rembrandt and Spinoza,2243,2244,2245
6,there was no connection between,2244,2801
6,Although on the other hand,2246,2778,3066
6,surely would have at least,2251,3150
6,All of this would have,2257,2503
6,would have been said in,2257,2496
6,for no other reason than,2271,3184
6,may not have climbed into,2282,2365
6,remained equidistant from each other,2284,2288
6,something that does not exist,2293,2293
6,Willem de Kooning 's teacher,2301,2320,2321,2330,2331
6,that Willem de Kooning was,2303,2339
6,could certainly catch that tortoise,2311,3587
6,I had meant to write,2321,3029
6,up my mind to imagine,2340,2346
6,a soccer shirt With the,2348,3752
6,I have just decided to,2369,3446
6,even though I have not,2382,2414
6,was said to have died,2392,2438
6,On my honor it was,2395,2750
6,only because of having mentioned,2409,2438
6,exists in my head even,2414,2415
6,Which is to say the,2417,2631,3788
6,a certain amount of the,2419,2865
6,a reproduction of the painting,2420,2424
6,which is not a real,2428,2428
6,being only in my head,2429,2508
6,reminds me of is that,2439,2692,2934
6,to the spring again to,2463,3794
6,something to do with the,2468,2632
6,existed only in my head,2475,2526
6,I have no doubt that,2479,2694
6,I did not put it,2483,2650
6,in Toledo when El Greco,2485,2487
6,what I am talking about,2486,3583
6,one doubts that either of,2504,2785
6,Even if I am perhaps,2528,2727
6,Although I do believe I,2564,2624
6,believe I have mentioned the,2564,3052
6,more than once perplexed me,2565,2822
6,Even if I did not,2576,2848
6,which had been translated from,2600,2713
6,but had been written in,2619,2713
6,familiar with the names of,2622,2704
6,have only been because of,2624,3466
6,Juana Ines of the Cross,2629,2631
6,had something to do with,2632,2703
6,it is no more than,2632,2733
6,as I believe I have,2658,3052
6,I believe I have said,2658,2822,3464
6,have been a life of,2660,2784
6,been a life of Brahms,2660,3769
6,Kathleen Ferrier singing Vincenzo Bellini,2672,2672
6,it to tell the truth,2693,2882,2990
6,thought it may have been,2699,2923
6,the names of the writers,2704,2712
6,the carton that I was,2711,2771
6,Although what I am really,2740,2970,3085
6,may very well have been,2745,2894,2951
6,other book from the carton,2771,2811
6,photographs of Lawrence of Arabia,2773,2779,2783
6,every single word in the,2786,2787
6,Even if on second thought,2787,3329
6,I am reading is in,2790,2793
6,Lawrence of Arabia would not,2807,2819
6,that it was also the,2811,2812
6,as it happens is that,2812,2830
6,to be thought of as,2830,3115
6,agreeable to be able to,2830,3350
6,lately to tell the truth,2832,3725
6,I have been thinking about,2834,3122
6,being too tall for the,2834,3747
6,it what with not having,2844,3739
6,At any rate it is,2879,3791
6,that there would have been,2902,3050
6,Every single time I have,2939,3342,3343,3344
6,Have I ever said that,2981,3221
6,incidentally if I have not,3008,3756
6,to begin with of course,3054,3708
6,but decided that in a,3067,3070
6,would be a more interesting,3067,3070
6,it is equally possible that,3069,3203
6,only twenty or thirty ships,3072,3073
6,forced to suspect is that,3079,3175
6,lived happily together ever after,3104,3115
6,be saying palace of course,3110,3128
6,likely it would have been,3160,3504
6,fairly certain I have mentioned,3178,3179
6,pharmacist would have put it,3200,3201
6,had just gotten a cat,3267,3269
6,And even if it was,3283,3542
6,even if it was not,3283,3675
6,visited at my studio himself,3288,3289
6,Certainly I have thought about,3322,3585
6,one of the Bachianas Brasileiras,3337,3343
6,the Bachianas Brasileiras by Villa-Lobos,3337,3339
6,permitted to have a cat,3404,3417
6,not have had a cat,3406,3411
6,after the rain had stopped,3434,3580
6,is not really a cat,3448,3772
6,had anything to do with,3456,3472,3474
6,anything to do with my,3456,3457
6,why I was feeling depressed,3476,3485
6,village not far from Oaxaca,3497,3508
6,I would sometimes say when,3506,3507
6,a good deal of both,3545,3545
6,that I did not intend,3591,3607
6,very little else to write,3602,3608
6,And which is to say,3617,3684
6,to keep out of my,3625,3652
6,Well and poor all the,3715,3719
6,past seven or eight weeks,3723,3726
6,how could I have once,3764,3765
6,it is far too chilly,3791,3792
5,living in the Louvre,1,1259,1262
5,the messages would say,1,874
5,in the National Gallery,1,73,244,246,1883,2268,2343
5,when I was in,2,412,493,2308
5,would say when I,2,3495
5,when I was still,2,322,1164,3543
5,it was when I,5,286
5,I do not know,8,1119,2484
5,But in either case,11,580,3381,3612
5,to visit at the,11,37
5,I have forgotten the,13,2145
5,And at any rate,14,3184,3791
5,at any rate I,14,1213,1593
5,to be called the,14,2825
5,Even in late spring,18,2451
5,had been Helen 's,20,3059
5,near the end of,20,926
5,I had planned to,24,111
5,In any case on,25,1057
5,where Achilles was buried,26,27
5,What I did was,29,112,352,486,1669
5,I did was pick,29,1169
5,by way of the,29,1099,1099
5,of the Greek islands,29,197
5,Such as for instance,32,845,2032
5,All of this being,35,566
5,may well have been,35,78,645,997,1522
5,the name of one,40,814
5,here in this house,43,57,114
5,house on this beach,43,1230
5,say that It has,44,843,3459
5,that It has come,44,2133
5,on the backs of,44,2673
5,almost forgotten about it,45,494
5,I am certain that,46,1000
5,at the Metropolitan Museum,49,484
5,So that the smoke,52,54,2943
5,I did that with,54,143
5,from one of the,54,306
5,one of the balconies,54,305
5,one can see the,59,76,2968
5,second house on this,60,1230
5,though perhaps I had,60,1646
5,I walked to the,60,1424
5,when I looked back,60,880,2899
5,walk along the beach,62,805,1220
5,think about it The,65,2283
5,Although doubtless I have,67,858,3288,3738
5,in an automobile with,68,496
5,once that same winter,69,2448
5,being almost hit by,69,1133

5,I lived at the,75,102

5,it was not the,80,663,718,2234

5,the top of the,87,756
5,of the Spanish Steps,87,388
5,except that I had,87,2487
5,Volkswagen van full of,87,976
5,one after the other,87,3638
5,each one of them,88,3638
5,Well perhaps it was,93,3532
5,could still see the,94,113
5,Well as I have,94,2581,2669,3611
5,perhaps I did not,94,1219,2471
5,I did not really,94,1377
5,I do not go,97,998
5,not go to the,97,583
5,in the opposite direction,99,867,1193,1289
5,Even if it is,100,817,2791,3772,3789
5,In the beginning I,103,104,322
5,as well Such as,104,2809
5,on the morning after,110,1598,3676
5,morning after I had,110,1683
5,in my rearview mirror,113,1291,3525
5,when I began to,121,1106
5,I got rid of,122,136
5,Not too long ago,125,1218,1805,2167
5,Les Troyens by Berlioz,125,980,1823
5,that I believed I,127,357
5,I believed I had,127,2898
5,where I am sitting,131,401,2076
5,In fact there is,133,829
5,fact there is a,133,786
5,perhaps indicate that there,138,2129
5,Especially when I was,139,3218
5,when I was mad,139,1258
5,understood why I was,145,3476
5,that doubtless I would,145,2987
5,that I read the,148,1131
5,when I drove the,153,976
5,not remember if I,159,2557
5,I drove right past,160,847
5,while I am typing,163,564
5,if I happen to,167,2651
5,in either case the,168,440,961
5,also say that I,171,2778
5,for what earthly reason,176,1460
5,I lived in Madrid,178,184
5,as it turned out,180,758,2866,3296
5,shed most of my,181,1114
5,they had named after,184,3040
5,on my way from,191,1057
5,spinnaker taking noisy wind,191,3091
5,One moment I was,193,859,1134
5,that there was the,193,3276
5,Would it have been,195,330
5,ought to have said,199,2815
5,I have said that,207,245,682,3464
5,wear nothing at all,209,1319
5,Well I have more,211,2230
5,all the way to,214,1666
5,and there is a,216,1073
5,make use of my,218,3477
5,by the way In,221,2975
5,still be able to,221,1240
5,at the gas station,224,820,855
5,is not one of,227,787
5,not one of the,227,2221
5,that many of the,227,2604
5,have already been dead,231,3258
5,as if I were,231,1911
5,all over again ?,231,2318
5,doubtless there was no,233,374,376
5,I have never been,235,1645,2815
5,never been to the,235,1085
5,on my own part,239,1351,2215
5,so many of them,242,1989,2572
5,There is a painting,244,2452
5,painting of Penelope weaving,244,414
5,by somebody named Pintoricchio,244,3177
5,that is on the,246,3325
5,on the island of,246,1586
5,'s head after all,248,3652
5,I should also perhaps,249,2129
5,perhaps point out that,249,2803
5,the painting of Penelope,253,414
5,is that there is,253,1879,3177
5,a ball of yarn,253,2112
5,Still it is perhaps,254,2640
5,if I have been,254,3571
5,could not have been,263,1172
5,and dropping them into,263,3072
5,them into the fire,263,1308
5,than I do about,265,1843
5,I doubt that I,268,324,1280
5,that I remember The,268,2470
5,in my head But,270,1535
5,Although it was not,281,1331
5,In fact I also,283,2754
5,I believe it was,286,2855,3361
5,when I went back,286,876
5,I did that In,286,354,1024
5,Across the wide Mississippi,289,3525
5,for instance in his,291,2032
5,Agamemnon had sacrificed their,291,3086
5,for the Greek ships,291,1334
5,For that matter it,293,1703
5,For some years I,295,782
5,taking the trouble to,296,3366
5,side of the road,296,1772
5,Hector ran and ran,297,2391
5,that this was the,298,603
5,that may have been,300,351
5,may have been one,300,1453
5,Heaven only knows why,301,3415
5,At one of the,302,359,3222
5,on one of the,305,523
5,so that it would,307,2595
5,in The Trojan Women,315,317,1445,3056
5,at my loft in,322,2144
5,sound of the sea,326,385
5,right at this moment,327,1811,2076,3727
5,certain that I had,331,3744
5,wore an alarm clock,334,2274
5,I would say it,335,2459
5,ever read The Recognitions,335,3076
5,I am more likely,336,2894
5,When I say they,346,810,2567
5,In a town called,347,1694
5,in the car and,350,352
5,some time before I,355,1231
5,I am positive that,356,358,1014,3247
5,the cat which was,356,2131
5,I mean that I,357,947
5,As quickly as I,362,1386
5,that would have been,362,3109
5,full to begin with,366,927
5,may have been a,371,3545
5,the cat Calpurnia after,375,899
5,this beach that I,377,1230
5,I was not mad,380,409
5,set fire to them,381,531
5,the sound of the,385,951,1146
5,intending to ask for,388,3638
5,I had no idea,389,1702,3470
5,on top of which,394,2429
5,I was forced to,395,1175
5,would be able to,401,1019
5,be able to see,401,1408
5,Every last one of,405,2826,2839
5,I have also just,407,567,2511
5,when I was not,409,1258,1439
5,it is already tomorrow,418,419
5,to fill up with,421,440
5,and then I went,421,3508
5,Yesterday 's sunset was,422,806
5,being aware of it,423,2277
5,I suspect I have,426,2306,2605,2620
5,called Savona which is,433,1630
5,Part of the embankment,434,1248
5,I did not feel,441,471
5,Or perhaps it was,441,1935,2944
5,what kind of a,446,2518
5,that I have just,451,1904
5,what happened was that,452,1255,1416,1598,1755,3239,3284
5,I had climbed back,453,979
5,I had been driving,455,1141
5,is that I was,456,2511
5,of ever having driven,457,1648
5,it was not a,466,1176,3675
5,by the time I,467,947,1321,2729,3258
5,was a painting of,468,1056
5,I did not go,469,2848
5,there could well be,476,2702
5,It is agreeable to,479,3153
5,able to find the,481,3328
5,I rarely did portraits,483,1042,1398
5,all of my paintings,485,491
5,for so many years,489,3192
5,One of those I,493,814
5,the Via Vittorio Veneto,494,1121,1663
5,Early in the Renaissance,497,3687
5,next door to that,500,707
5,that same tiny mirror,504,3588
5,Yet it is not,507,557,2030
5,like Leonardo da Vinci,507,2905
5,I also believe I,510,802
5,believe one word of,511,1280
5,Andrea del Sarto and,511,3718
5,remember any longer if,512,2922
5,In fact it was,514,1046,1693,2215,2316,2344,2549
5,all we ever called,516,2130
5,when the snows come,517,1192
5,hidden and the beach,517,3677
5,fires along the beach,519,2038,2040
5,I tore the pages,521,531
5,Most of the pages,522,3767
5,right next to me,522,3767
5,say that I sometimes,524,1243
5,But I do believe,526,2145
5,book in this house,526,1473
5,in this house which,526,2836
5,in this house is,528,1013
5,to remind myself where,528,993
5,when I decided to,529,1416
5,very much like this,530,965
5,behind where the painting,530,544
5,in such a way,530,2222,3584
5,to simulate a seagull,531,1224
5,two lives of Brahms,532,664,823
5,singing The Alto Rhapsody,533,677
5,perplexed as to how,539,2528
5,for the fact that,542,3273
5,only now realize that,543,1834
5,realize that I may,543,1038
5,I may not have,543,2811
5,that other house to,543,657
5,house to the ground,543,1250,3642
5,in the process of,543,881
5,of The Trojan Women,543,1447,2600,2827
5,into the fire after,543,2446
5,life of Brahms I,544,661,1522
5,out on the beach,544,663
5,without being reminded of,551,552
5,that El Greco was,552,557,925
5,so many years But,558,3192
5,But who is to,558,1520
5,go back even farther,558,2337
5,even farther than that,558,2299
5,does appear to be,560,795
5,I had not noticed,562,1162,1631
5,If it is a,563,2682
5,is fairly abstract at,563,1104
5,window while I am,564,593
5,and on the wall,565,567
5,at the same time,565,2482,2812,3107,3489
5,Although I have also,567,1513
5,just closed my eyes,567,573,3029
5,do the same thing,568,3699
5,I have only now,569,965
5,I happen to have,571,2651
5,in the painting itself,575,580
5,begin to trouble me,575,2794
5,Unquestionably there would have,577,1173
5,with the exception of,578,2881
5,inside of the house,580,581
5,of the house in,580,1237,2558
5,house in the painting,580,954
5,Then again very likely,582,1690
5,one is forced to,583,2445
5,go to the beach,583,1097
5,on second thought I,584,1108,2432,3329,3450
5,I have decided that,584,1474
5,I will try to,588,2759
5,Even if I will,589,3798
5,in this house either,589,1005
5,to do is to,590,3446
5,in regard to the,591,763,2243
5,and while I was,594,2864
5,while I was still,594,1304
5,I was still looking,594,1164
5,even though they were,600,2182
5,Unless of course the,601,2239
5,Such things can happen,602,1218,1807,2861
5,that Guy de Maupassant,604,605
5,did not wish to,605,668,1974,3588
5,of my own as,607,3182
5,Doubtless I had not,613,1326
5,if it is still,615,3789
5,not have gotten to,618,3170
5,remember the name of,619,3472
5,with all of those,619,2417,3700
5,in either case not,620,3381
5,it was somebody named,625,883
5,that one could even,627,1982
5,of course So that,636,2982
5,At the intersection of,641,689,1307,2946,3328
5,a window in a,642,1421
5,saw my own reflection,645,706
5,the one that I,646,1648
5,to let myself into,646,2759
5,when one types it,650,1567
5,would have been difficult,652,2595
5,not being able to,653,3472,3531
5,I have now made,655,2346
5,of the other house,656,1370
5,I can not call,657,1831
5,that house and this,658,1408
5,Houses along a beach,659,1214
5,fact I can not,660,2660
5,entered my mind to,661,1038
5,that it was not,663,1176
5,Unless as I have,664,3394
5,as I have suggested,664,2276
5,Well and the other,667,1870
5,the person in the,667,2782
5,this could have been,669,2154,2732
5,been at the window,670,833
5,Yesterday when I was,677,840
5,when I was hearing,677,839
5,The Alto Rhapsody what,677,3343
5,almost as if one,683,3679
5,Though perhaps it was,685,696,1312
5,I had intended to,685,2951
5,to begin with on,685,2902
5,somebody called my name,689,721
5,almost wished to weep,694,1686
5,even before I had,710,2900,3620
5,for me to have,712,2735,3762
5,into the book on,714,1844
5,for what it might,714,1687
5,in spite of my,717,1000
5,been out of sorts,717,1359
5,doubtless it was not,718,1639
5,had been coming on,720,3681
5,was one of the,728,2577,2682,3196,3343,3380
5,remind me of the,735,2982
5,What I had been,739,764,984,1106,1303,2045,2939,2941
5,that one has no,740,940
5,one has no way,740,2799
5,Until such time as,741,2838
5,it was a wind,742,743
5,to do was to,743,1048,1409,1757
5,being what I thought,746,1418
5,to close my thighs,748,2875
5,however I believe I,757,2475
5,at maneuvering my wheelchair,758,2970
5,I had not done,766,2594
5,that there was a,777,1225,1416
5,Kirsten Flagstad was singing,778,1783
5,so as to have,779,2686
5,tape deck was playing,779,983
5,Or at least to,780,2795
5,made it necessary to,780,1048
5,When I was living,783,1259
5,There is no longer,785,1238
5,by the way Even,785,2775
5,It is not one,787,2030,2319
5,in the basement also,788,793
5,in addition to the,788,1472
5,the remainder of the,790,2786
5,that in the painting,791,1885
5,baseballs in the basement,793,804
5,There is also a,794,1472
5,been mowed at the,796,958
5,written by Friedrich Nietzsche,798,799
5,are continually looking in,800,1502
5,I stopped at the,804,1168
5,at the point where,804,3354
5,I came to the,804,2793
5,I went for a,805,2005
5,the other house which,805,1366
5,If it is not,826,3772
5,it is not a,826,1175
5,somebody who had been,833,2151
5,In either case it,834,2365
5,ago when I was,839,1119
5,the painting back into,841,1881
5,the day after tomorrow,843,2849
5,Willem de Kooning and,852,2364
5,I suspect it is,853,2188
5,to be connected to,853,1609,1902,1902
5,my loft in SoHo,854,2144
5,Although what I really,856,3794
5,It was on that,862,1251
5,burning to the ground,863,1090
5,because of the way,869,2834
5,to write in the,870,873
5,in the sand with,870,909,2317,3643
5,still there when I,876,2903
5,back in any case,876,2903
5,that I might have,879,2974,3233,3431,3751
5,that it might be,881,2900
5,this new habit of,882,2467
5,too even if I,888,1513
5,In addition to which,889,1642,2237,2421
5,why this reminds me,889,3003
5,this reminds me of,889,2439
5,the gold coins that,895,2131
5,Rembrandt 's cat was,901,3185
5,it so happens that,902,2132
5,to think of Aristotle,905,906
5,chewing on a pencil,907,918
5,it is doubtless not,910,2380
5,in fact there are,915,2666
5,in the painting by,916,1885
5,The Rape of Helen,917,1273
5,I still can not,921,2941
5,practically three thousand years,925,2343
5,when he was still,932,1827
5,Still for some reason,935,1672
5,it strikes me as,935,1965
5,affair with Jane Avril,935,1970
5,some of the other,936,3254
5,would also appear to,940,1934
5,no idea how one,940,2583
5,of course Even if,948,2630
5,the cat outside of,950,2128
5,thinking about a cat,951,962,3211
5,except insofar as the,951,952,956
5,should one wish to,954,1905
5,Although perhaps this is,956,1789
5,possibly what I have,956,1937
5,there having been no,956,1607
5,at the side of,958,1772
5,I was typing that,963,1108
5,Surely one can not,964,2293
5,Actually all I had,967,2098
5,all I had been,967,3580
5,Although I do not,968,1303
5,I am also now,969,3416
5,In fact I am,975,1000,1273,3247,3727
5,this is of course,977,2498
5,The Seasons by Vivaldi,978,1805,1823
5,Even after I had,979,2106
5,For some time I,981,1327
5,manner in which I,985,1413
5,which I did not,985,1547,2852
5,In this instance I,987,2381,3076
5,make an educated guess,987,1490
5,that would appear to,989,1231
5,would appear to remain,989,1351
5,me is that I,990,2513,2749,2938
5,in this house are,991,2830
5,not appear to be,995,3751
5,may have only been,997,2493,2624
5,In which case the,997,1476
5,as a sort of,997,3112
5,by the same painter,999,1002
5,only one of the,1001,1339,3366
5,that I have been,1016,1195
5,there might be any,1017,3639
5,a certain number of,1021,1154,1509,3258
5,in the Borghese Gallery,1023,1077
5,I signed a mirror,1023,2448
5,I am assuming that,1035,3405
5,that I had never,1043,1229
5,make use of the,1048,3217
5,For some reason the,1055,1274,1880
5,the thought of this,1055,1504
5,has always saddened me,1055,1504
5,I was surprised that,1056,2635
5,I did not stop,1057,2793
5,how long the embankment,1059,1650
5,more real than the,1061,2909
5,I do not feel,1069,1109
5,I have not been,1070,2833,3750
5,have to go back,1072,1483
5,in the painting is,1076,3179
5,at all when one,1086,2761
5,even if I had,1091,1813,1881,2595,2630,3396,3470
5,that one would have,1093,1609,2906,2908
5,I no longer had,1096,1392
5,the way I had,1099,3214
5,one would wish to,1101,3533
5,carry to a spring,1101,3425
5,is that I am,1102,2420,2426,3082
5,case doubtless I was,1105,1262
5,my feeling this way,1105,1108
5,I could look back,1107,1925
5,it all over again,1108,2318
5,Even if one would,1116,1519,3469,3777
5,at the boat basin,1119,1179
5,If it was not,1123,3283,3675
5,Kierkegaard or Martin Heidegger,1124,1474,1540
5,of one 's baggage,1125,2979
5,as I have perhaps,1125,1680,2124
5,all of these people,1127,2507
5,I have just now,1131,1890
5,morning when I was,1132,1682
5,I have mentioned being,1133,2836
5,in heaven 's name,1138,2644,3085,3658
5,condition of being startled,1140,1147
5,for quite some time,1140,2525,2553,3681
5,and which I had,1141,3486
5,at all that I,1143,1323
5,when I say it,1144,2654
5,Certainly it would have,1145,2159,3064
5,I was not really,1147,3346
5,by David Alfaro Siqueiros,1149,2961
5,that it had been,1152,1214
5,any number of other,1153,1153
5,surely I would have,1160,1263,1845
5,which I had not,1162,2594
5,let myself into the,1163,3040
5,all of this having,1164,3271,3497
5,had not begun to,1167,1168
5,morning on which I,1168,2852
5,All I did was,1169,2840
5,And which in fact,1170,2580
5,I have brought in,1190,3729
5,the path to the,1195,1242
5,in much the same,1199,1750
5,that I no longer,1205,1392
5,I can not imagine,1206,1860
5,In fact it is,1207,1910,1948,2887,3154,3335,3780,3792
5,as a tool for,1210,1210
5,For some reason I,1217,1672,2296
5,I seem to have,1217,1933
5,I have also been,1223,3331
5,life of Brahms ?,1223,2386
5,in trying to simulate,1224,1845
5,have now and again,1226,3068
5,I have just made,1229,2348,2648
5,board by board and,1231,1233
5,quite some time before,1231,3681
5,think in walking past,1233,1239
5,one can still see,1237,2451
5,house in which I,1237,1431
5,that I used to,1240,2644
5,For some period I,1241,3372
5,it is by having,1243,2314
5,on the night that,1249,1250
5,too now that I,1254,3728
5,that I woke up,1255,2687
5,I woke up in,1255,1262
5,beside the Pont Neuf,1255,1260
5,periods when I was,1258,1258
5,In either case doubtless,1262,1613,3612
5,Almost every one of,1268,2178
5,one of the books,1268,1592
5,into one of the,1271,2943,3744
5,fact I am quite,1273,2978
5,is said to have,1279,1562
5,if one wishes to,1279,2117
5,one word of it,1280,1578
5,The things one knows,1282,1830
5,is the scene in,1284,1445
5,Although I believe I,1286,1305
5,I did leave out,1287,3313,3543
5,that I have not,1288,1925,2665,2833
5,a single one of,1288,2378
5,more often than not,1291,3720
5,that I was feeling,1295,2102
5,the latter having been,1304,2057
5,had a pet seagull,1312,2747
5,The cat in the,1313,3179
5,that I am writing,1314,1610
5,Although I am perhaps,1315,1486,1916
5,What I more exactly,1317,3465
5,had gotten rid of,1323,2979
5,gotten rid of my,1323,2669
5,one day I had,1324,1351
5,I had been looking,1324,1383
5,And on third thought,1332,2699
5,think about it although,1333,1724
5,did or did not,1334,1463
5,do a painting of,1334,2981
5,is not my trade,1335,1714,2315,3654
5,the same pope who,1336,1339
5,a way in which,1337,1879
5,possibly it was only,1339,2118
5,was not the same,1339,2234
5,that any of these,1340,1347
5,what I more truthfully,1340,1558
5,Hugo van der Goes,1343,1344,1621
5,people in this world,1347,2835
5,eating one 's lunch,1350,3694
5,I have no intention,1361,2845
5,what I wrote about,1361,2489
5,before I came back,1364,2649
5,I do not often,1365,3744
5,In fact I was,1370,1463
5,at all when I,1370,3214,3540
5,able to locate the,1372,3750
5,to locate the road,1372,1378,1382
5,for the longest time,1372,2105,2510,3415
5,when I say I,1375,3256
5,away from the town,1376,1387
5,I am going to,1382,1787,2431
5,I decided to do,1383,1757
5,to do so that,1383,2408
5,In fact what I,1386,3102,3242
5,past that fallen tree,1391,1451
5,of the roof of,1394,1645
5,It is likely that,1395,2682
5,appear to indicate that,1397,3170
5,a view of the,1400,1400
5,little more than an,1402,1420
5,was to see if,1404,1569
5,the person who wrote,1410,2985
5,who wrote the instructions,1410,2001
5,on an afternoon when,1416,2141,2144
5,walk through the woods,1416,1528
5,There is my house,1418,1536,1775,3326
5,of this sort of,1419,1504,3034
5,Doubtless I would have,1420,1568,1844,2274,2730,2987
5,distinctly remember the poster,1424,1533
5,The life of Beethoven,1432,1433,1472
5,Then again what one,1436,3129
5,what one is now,1436,3175
5,not happen to be,1436,2836,3324
5,of Anna Karenina in,1437,2706
5,a copy of The,1440,1473,1511
5,twelve or fifteen years,1440,1441
5,about T. E. Shaw,1443,1612
5,T. E. Shaw and,1443,2790
5,T. E. Shaw was,1443,2802
5,I have just eaten,1455,1904
5,give almost anything for,1457,1458
5,that it was Odysseus,1460,1514
5,None of which has,1471,1872
5,with the fact that,1471,2723
5,As I have indicated,1473,2591,3065
5,the identical book in,1473,1731
5,Martin Heidegger after all,1474,2692
5,the question of the,1475,1626
5,Have I mentioned that,1498,3781
5,by the way ?,1498,2911,3667
5,Once in the National,1500,1883
5,could have scarcely been,1501,3762
5,of course what with,1501,1659
5,why so many people,1502,3422
5,Hector 's little boy,1506,1589
5,in regard to this,1508,2818
5,A few days ago,1509,1848
5,for instance when I,1509,2134,2482
5,that Alexander the Great,1509,1511
5,And for that matter,1510,2917,3699
5,for that matter that,1510,2299
5,I have also now,1513,1959
5,I have forgotten what,1513,1673
5,that any number of,1519,2273
5,as well even if,1519,2179,2797
5,I decided to walk,1528,2891
5,able to verify that,1533,2226
5,that I had ever,1533,2733
5,it was on the,1535,1683
5,on the wall in,1535,1535
5,I was seeing was,1536,3326
5,I did once read,1547,2204
5,after all which I,1547,2822
5,if he had been,1551,1569
5,is because of the,1559,2834
5,that she was sensible,1560,1561
5,who had been a,1561,2151
5,had been a child,1561,2684
5,also played an instrument,1563,2751
5,while I was at,1569,2898
5,even if one does,1572,2163
5,now and again become,1572,2744
5,that I have no,1577,3723,3726
5,I bring this up,1587,2737
5,that there is any,1588,1689,2770
5,he was supposed to,1593,3383
5,I did read a,1595,2661
5,out of a window,1598,2676
5,any number of people,1606,2273,3609
5,to begin with but,1606,2084
5,the footnote was in,1608,1613
5,one would have never,1609,2049
5,that T. E. Shaw,1610,2805
5,was in no way,1613,3038
5,Maria Callas singing that,1614,1715
5,across one of the,1615,1763
5,and so had not,1615,3187
5,up with Vincenzo Bellini,1617,1712
5,still another person I,1623,2620
5,so as not to,1623,2059,3199
5,had to have been,1627,1649
5,Andrea Mantegna 's brother-in-law,1628,1712
5,filled with picture postcards,1630,2533
5,explanation for why it,1633,3186
5,as soon as the,1635,3212
5,I had already gotten,1636,2892
5,that my shoulder had,1638,1639
5,I have been driving,1641,3222
5,all I was thinking,1641,2181
5,that I was thinking,1645,2699
5,as to whether the,1647,2830
5,appeared to have been,1650,2660
5,As a general rule,1651,2814
5,turned out to be,1656,2062,2171,3573
5,below the Borghese Gallery,1663,2946
5,the rest of my,1667,3795
5,put on the shirt,1669,1709
5,while I was waiting,1669,1670
5,this was because the,1674,2613
5,question as to whether,1677,2830
5,is in no way,1678,1953,2888
5,in no way a,1678,3038
5,that at the time,1688,1865,3044
5,I had been equally,1695,3745
5,believe that I was,1698,1980
5,had no idea that,1702,2157
5,would have hardly been,1707,3105
5,I had already put,1709,1853
5,being still another person,1712,2620
5,to eat his pigments,1716,1894
5,Flaubert once wrote Maupassant,1721,1722
5,same letter to Brahms,1724,1725
5,only part of the,1725,3518
5,to Alfred North Whitehead,1725,2685
5,would have even been,1735,3112
5,to go into exile,1736,1738
5,In any event I,1747,1919,2264
5,Then again I have,1749,2533
5,is that I have,1753,2815,3089,3340
5,reason to mention them,1753,1754
5,The tennis balls I,1758,1774,1778
5,tennis balls that I,1758,1759
5,have lost their bounce,1760,1761
5,hit tennis balls across,1763,1767
5,that one of them,1767,2249
5,well in spite of,1768,2519
5,the same thing as,1775,2672
5,part of the time,1776,3518
5,I have not forgotten,1777,2320
5,hitting the tennis balls,1778,1840
5,at the beach I,1781,1782
5,that the tape deck,1784,2671
5,was ever able to,1805,2226
5,come into my head,1809,2381,3386
5,Just the other morning,1810,1814
5,been thinking about it,1813,2834
5,had to begin to,1813,2794
5,when I typed those,1813,2764
5,from the Cross at,1814,1885
5,a painting in the,1818,2452
5,in either case was,1822,2091
5,was that I had,1822,3029
5,I would keep on,1823,2206
5,thinking about Les Troyens,1823,2303
5,can not see the,1832,3693
5,in The Last Supper,1834,2344
5,it was somebody else,1837,2749
5,whom I do not,1838,3489
5,with the life of,1842,2383
5,life of Samuel Butler,1842,1843
5,read a life of,1843,2661
5,positive I have never,1843,3339
5,trying to simulate seagulls,1845,3766
5,any number of the,1863,3731
5,When my mother was,1864,3588
5,when he took away,1866,2345
5,by the way I,1873,3214,3331,3424,3686
5,in my head is,1875,2416,2424
5,a few pages ago,1876,2635
5,way in which the,1879,2834
5,the painting itself is,1880,2453
5,a fact that the,1884,3169,3272
5,is not something I,1888,2077
5,in any case it,1894,2138,2765
5,I was eating myself,1895,1895
5,was mad he once,1896,2060
5,in Van Gogh 's,1899,3439
5,mean to give any,1900,1922
5,incidentally even if I,1900,2929
5,connected to the subject,1901,1902
5,have appeared to be,1902,3251,3725
5,In fact I would,1905,3019,3352
5,I might have worn,1909,1910
5,in which case I,1910,1997,3259
5,it would have always,1911,1912
5,And in any event,1919,2282
5,I have been writing,1925,2389
5,is that I once,1931,3231
5,one of these figures,1939,2376
5,quite possibly the only,1956,2745
5,did not have children,1957,1975
5,what I have also,1959,2859
5,been the first person,1964,2977
5,perhaps it is the,1969,3423
5,who did not have,1975,2757
5,I do wish that,1987,2795
5,a great deal of,1988,2529
5,is that it was,1996,2812
5,I was trying to,1997,2319,2404,3766
5,too as it happens,2000,2460
5,And in the meantime,2002,3016,3305,3446
5,I felt like doing,2004,3458
5,Have I said that,2007,2410
5,is one more thing,2009,3223
5,In fact the entire,2025,2703
5,would not have thought,2026,2029
5,he would not have,2029,2222
5,all of those swirls,2032,2417
5,a garbage disposal area,2035,2109,3436
5,garbage disposal area in,2035,2413
5,would have to be,2037,3477
5,when I have built,2040,2041
5,that Alfred North Whitehead,2053,3440
5,was somebody else who,2054,2749,3705
5,as well have been,2067,2249
5,Although doubtless it is,2077,2693,2701
5,it is not something,2077,2668
5,Although what I would,2088,3771
5,to suggest that there,2091,2770
5,would have been any,2091,2902
5,would have been leery,2095,3401
5,a considerable number of,2097,3244
5,in Corinth New York,2099,2109
5,what it was that,2102,3578
5,was that I was,2102,2704
5,and the cat which,2114,2129,2291
5,there was a cat,2118,3420
5,subject for a book,2122,3075
5,I have perhaps said,2124,3230
5,up a name for,2128,3205
5,is connected to the,2131,2180
5,that I have now,2132,2974,3684
5,In fact now that,2133,2818
5,I did remember to,2134,3319
5,with Rembrandt having been,2136,2146
5,Even if russet is,2137,2358
5,a color that has,2138,2138
5,than Willem de Kooning,2141,2325,3596
5,the afternoon on which,2145,2533
5,for Willem de Kooning,2146,2221
5,the cat 's name,2146,2365
5,de Kooning would have,2147,2178
5,Willem de Kooning is,2149,2347,2356,2362
5,might not have been,2150,2333
5,from somebody who had,2150,2151
5,many people would have,2153,3422
5,did not have any,2156,2757
5,Willem de Kooning himself,2159,2325
5,the man who taught,2160,2325
5,have been mentioned in,2162,3403
5,had a pupil named,2170,2177
5,this sort of thing,2173,2916,3034,3068
5,seem to remember that,2177,2283
5,even though I would,2177,3625
5,admired about Van Gogh,2182,2695
5,could make even a,2182,2695
5,a pair of boots,2182,2693,2695,2696
5,Cezanne once said that,2183,2430
5,painted like a madman,2183,2430
5,scratching at my window,2187,2187
5,one of them ever,2211,2718
5,a solitary thought to,2211,3526
5,that Carel Fabritius was,2219,2221
5,having been descended from,2219,2325
5,that I myself have,2220,2426
5,questions in art history,2225,2250
5,Carel Fabritius may have,2226,2928
5,as I have also,2229,2551,2659
5,does happen to be,2231,3137
5,Or at any rate,2240,3604
5,Even if there was,2244,2696
5,has always had to,2250,2834
5,that Rembrandt and Spinoza,2251,2482
5,certainly they would have,2253,2498
5,they would have exchanged,2253,2502
5,on an occasion when,2262,3764
5,think about Taddeo Gaddi,2264,2266
5,to think about that,2265,3186
5,Even if one is,2267,2445,2658,3050
5,happened to be a,2269,2771
5,about a man who,2274,3075
5,have gone through life,2277,3614
5,I did not even,2280,2479
5,in any event the,2282,3674
5,about it the more,2283,3016
5,to be equidistant from,2291,2293
5,Or for that matter,2299,2675,3309,3639
5,a pupil of the,2299,2323
5,the tortoise could go,2310,2312
5,would still always be,2310,2312
5,I knew knew that,2311,3587
5,only the tiniest fraction,2312,2312
5,was not that I,2321,3726
5,Except that what I,2323,3602
5,that what I am,2323,3785
5,the person who was,2323,2323
5,And when Bertrand Russell,2327,3062
5,the perfect circle freehand,2339,3690
5,for all of those,2344,3574
5,in Giotto 's studio,2346,2360,2366
5,Rembrandt and Carel Fabritius,2352,2355
5,is that I do,2354,2692
5,have any idea what,2354,2930
5,necessary for me to,2355,2735
5,would give to a,2358,2614
5,of these cats is,2361,3184
5,fact Willem de Kooning,2362,2373
5,Vincent Van Gogh the,2367,2367
5,single one of them,2378,2598
5,if I were to,2385,2510,3621
5,Aeschylus 's bald head,2392,2394
5,a good number of,2404,3188,3256
5,is something else that,2413,2822
5,Except that in this,2414,3076
5,I have not yet,2414,2831
5,the fire either but,2416,2427
5,that I am not,2420,2714
5,is only a reproduction,2424,2428
5,started to say I,2426,3578
5,and which has now,2426,3657
5,Although what I have,2427,2882
5,as well because of,2444,2508
5,which as I have,2461,2659
5,I have said is,2461,2822
5,I was writing about,2468,2482,2526
5,would appear to exist,2472,2527
5,exist on these pages,2472,2473,2474,2475
5,on these pages as,2472,2508
5,certain things that one,2481,3522
5,does not happen to,2481,2836
5,a different sort of,2487,3435
5,is something I did,2490,2915
5,that even when one,2492,3648,3649
5,fact I believe I,2493,2756
5,Then again perhaps it,2494,2904
5,El Greco and Cervantes,2496,2498
5,Even if El Greco,2497,2498
5,would have been called,2504,2505
5,have been called of,2505,2807
5,called of the Cross,2505,2632
5,So that even if,2510,3594
5,I had not thought,2510,2630
5,I have mentioned it,2524,3340
5,would have only been,2525,3183,3466
5,one more thing I,2525,3223
5,would have been still,2526,3413
5,it would appear to,2527,3139
5,One would appear to,2529,2916
5,I woke up with,2530,2687
5,the pain is arthritic,2532,2554
5,even though I did,2533,3509
5,moving the rusted lawnmower,2540,2543,2590
5,One would hardly go,2543,3777
5,I was down there,2544,2553
5,I have mentioned that,2546,3179
5,is arthritic after all,2554,2868
5,in the basement which,2554,2986
5,on the day before,2555,2857
5,part of the house,2558,2559
5,I have no real,2560,3723
5,very little to do,2562,3642
5,no reason whatsoever for,2563,2591
5,to the basement yesterday,2563,2575,2848
5,to have thought of,2573,3415
5,Or in any event,2584,3674
5,which was the same,2584,3477
5,one of the cartons,2585,2586
5,of the cartons before,2585,2587
5,in the basement with,2591,2686
5,And in which instance,2593,3160
5,look through the books,2594,2595
5,in any event so,2595,3199
5,every single one of,2598,3252,3265
5,In fact I suspect,2605,3487
5,from the carton were,2610,2731
5,of these was a,2611,2713
5,amount of difficulty in,2612,3270
5,the chief reason I,2624,3257
5,of the Cross and,2631,2632
5,if one could have,2636,3679
5,reminded me of that,2644,3415
5,books by Martin Heidegger,2652,2658
5,even if it may,2660,3345
5,it has ever been,2661,3479
5,a thing one does,2664,2792
5,I have not read,2665,2665
5,read the back of,2665,2723
5,I do know about,2673,2990
5,on another level altogether,2678,2794
5,must have said to,2688,3375
5,ought to have been,2689,3540
5,you could actually see,2690,2740
5,that I do know,2692,2990
5,Vincent Van Gogh and,2693,3718
5,would have been the,2695,3054,3109,3224
5,on third thought it,2699,3621
5,by now there could,2702,3796
5,is that if the,2708,3032,3417
5,one word of German,2709,3234
5,in any way whatsoever,2711,3174
5,say that I am,2714,2778,3024
5,necessarily mean that I,2717,2718
5,mean that I am,2717,2973
5,I would not be,2723,3652
5,be familiar with the,2723,3224
5,I did not recognize,2728,2731
5,German writers after all,2731,2735
5,have been just as,2732,3365,3407
5,perhaps it was not,2735,3532
5,Well or because of,2738,2956
5,on their minds than,2743,3374
5,that quite possibly the,2745,3650
5,This would be the,2746,2870
5,is that I may,2749,2894
5,In fact I believe,2756,3742
5,Lawrence of Arabia however,2770,2798
5,Lawrence of Arabia had,2772,2922
5,made the assumption that,2773,3563
5,that Lawrence of Arabia,2778,2805
5,may very well be,2780,3186,3725
5,the fact that the,2782,3273
5,Nonetheless one is still,2783,3101
5,to Lawrence of Arabia,2788,2796
5,came to the name,2790,2793
5,name happened to be,2799,3284
5,at least it would,2800,3139
5,he was not a,2800,2976
5,Although when I say,2803,3110,3256,3370,3478,3538,3610,3665
5,Lawrence of Arabia was,2805,2811
5,is that when one,2808,2812
5,But in the meantime,2811,3210
5,the last book from,2811,2812
5,have said that I,2815,3464
5,never been able to,2815,3742
5,putting books into a,2817,2818
5,even if for some,2818,3666
5,books into a bathtub,2818,2819
5,which would have been,2819,2992,3401
5,only this tardily come,2822,3386
5,something else that has,2822,3652
5,and having no idea,2824,3471
5,no idea what it,2824,3755
5,one of these people,2824,3252,3284
5,Doubtless I have not,2832,3738
5,that quite possibly there,2838,2840
5,at this very instant,2843,2846
5,on its own part,2874,3635
5,by walking in it,2883,2886,3475
5,Oh And I have,2896,3787
5,it might have been,2904,2925
5,to be put in,2922,3137
5,one of the people,2926,3196,3366
5,now made me remember,2929,2930
5,I have said it,2939,3394
5,whatever became of my,2942,2962
5,the smoke from my,2943,3326
5,I have just mentioned,2944,3449
5,Although it is the,2955,3145
5,carton in the basement,2986,3380
5,carrying an old sock,2998,3000
5,in fact on the,3000,3201
5,would have been excited,3019,3422
5,that I had just,3029,3267
5,I have decided to,3045,3046
5,would have thought about,3045,3046
5,would have doubtless been,3047,3161
5,sailed to Troy in,3048,3049
5,on his own part,3060,3235
5,reason for the war,3064,3067
5,So that when one,3069,3517
5,here is that I,3082,3652
5,even if that is,3088,3275
5,Well or vice versa,3090,3333
5,fact what I have,3102,3105
5,the two of them,3102,3119,3204
5,One had been forgetting,3126,3164
5,Cassandra would have brought,3131,3135
5,a cat would have,3133,3133
5,Even if a cat,3133,3502
5,And which is surely,3143,3479
5,had left the table,3161,3165
5,that very likely it,3175,3504
5,Then again I may,3182,3404
5,as having been russet,3182,3184
5,of Rembrandt 's cat,3184,3223
5,even though I had,3186,3489
5,talking about and which,3191,3740
5,a name for your,3205,3371
5,in the meantime what,3210,3446
5,about that question of,3223,3419
5,I once spoke with,3231,3232
5,I wrote letters to,3244,3252,3253
5,the Queen of England,3248,3269
5,of the people I,3258,3282
5,with such people as,3260,3403
5,cat was not really,3273,3488
5,cat being what I,3278,3495
5,to write those letters,3281,3283
5,I have asked myself,3323,3324
5,having been able to,3328,3460,3487,3595
5,Although in the meantime,3334,3452
5,I have heard it,3341,3342
5,And which in the,3365,3494
5,that he would remember,3383,3384
5,one 's self in,3388,3531
5,And even if I,3396,3481,3756,3798
5,so many other cats,3399,3486
5,lived in a convent,3404,3405
5,there might have been,3414,3763
5,what I am also,3416,3623
5,what I have just,3446,3546
5,sitting at the typewriter,3454,3456
5,fact I have been,3462,3754
5,I once had another,3484,3485
5,being what I would,3495,3506
5,I would say when,3495,3496
5,Adam or I would,3496,3507
5,mad in the least,3516,3664
5,not been able to,3531,3750
5,one had done that,3544,3544
5,it was one 's,3559,3561
5,When all I had,3580,3723
5,I was alone obviously,3583,3623
5,one bit of that,3591,3722
5,So that what I,3605,3785
5,people who write novels,3608,3609
5,the only person in,3618,3619
5,an absolutely autobiographical novel,3621,3623
5,that it could be,3623,3624
5,sooner or later cross,3645,3646
5,manner of being alone,3647,3647
5,So that I am,3653,3729
5,to a world without,3667,3667
5,some time before that,3681,3739
5,for that matter poor,3699,3702,3720
5,Franz Schubert 's ghost,3701,3702
5,mentioned that I have,3738,3781
5,wearing the soccer shirt,3754,3755
5,to move the typewriter,3793,3799
4,in the street,0,73,873
4,certain of the,1,538,998,1492,3313
4,Or in the,1,726,1648
4,they could only,2,3687
4,say that when,2,1974
4,that when I,2,1375,3328
4,was still in,2,2240
4,Eventually I stopped,3,1221
4,that If I,5,2973
4,If I were,5,231,1911,2385,2510,2633,3621
4,were forced to,5,2838
4,forced to guess,5,589
4,Possibly it was,6,149,742,1339,2118,2512
4,longer ago than,6,37
4,And of course,7,3306,3721
4,of course I,7,366,831,2853
4,I was quite,7,96,1778
4,Which is a,9,1403
4,As when I,11,102,1114,1259,2793
4,And for some,12,2613
4,I had read,12,988
4,to the sea,12,14
4,used to be,14,3773
4,from the ruins,17,2451
4,one could see,17,600,1404
4,I believe in,19,1257
4,of the old,19,294
4,Helen 's lover,20,1510
4,it was Helen,21,143,1121
4,is perhaps an,24,2640,3607
4,perhaps an hour,24,1763
4,there in the,25,2442
4,say it is,27,2459
4,it took me,30,465
4,to get to,30,85
4,to Greece A,30,191
4,A good deal,30,67,139,1125,2052,2373,2755,3513,3545,3545,3684
4,Still certain things,31,95
4,certain things can,31,2307
4,It was that,33,46,190,1041,1131,1945,1959,2073,2102,3578
4,with the first,34,1887
4,to make my,34,1612
4,as I say,35,167,3299,3620
4,as I also,35,2489
4,have been mad,35,145
4,not at all,36,270,3353,3521
4,I had lost,37,2898
4,Why have I,38,672,1256
4,my little boy,39,1065
4,little boy was,39,1506
4,Meaning that one,40,740
4,one can even,40,907,1492
4,Conversely I am,45,2467
4,not even remember,46,2479
4,that I understood,46,1638
4,the fire I,51,2413
4,built the fire,51,2414
4,was in that,51,173
4,too So that,52,3121
4,I had to,53,121,2073
4,once I had,53,415,453,2591,2970,2984,3800
4,I had constructed,53,307
4,balconies so that,54,307
4,would go out,54,2943
4,in Not much,55,2865
4,Or of the,56,385
4,Nor do I,58,1393
4,mind the rain,58,2880
4,one 's view,59,2914
4,is my second,60,611
4,For a moment,60,268,1364,1853,1987
4,to the dunes,60,97,264,578,2768
4,the dunes to,60,1193
4,mornings when I,62,1698
4,when I walk,62,868
4,One is still,64,2783,3101
4,of a house,64,530,2586
4,as a house,64,1011,3127
4,have been if,66,1471
4,for my own,66,1703
4,the Metropolitan And,66,735
4,that by now,67,3796
4,by now as,67,1038
4,now as well,67,399
4,I do remember,68,885,2802
4,a car with,69,1176
4,near Hampstead Heath,69,1132
4,down the hill,70,1137,1141,1143,1174
4,having been the,71,2057,2136,2977,3195,3260
4,Although perhaps that,72,658
4,when I said,73,199,605,2511
4,I said I,73,2488
4,at the Tate,75,83,101,1698
4,intended to paint,80,80,2951
4,to paint was,80,302
4,a representation of,80,1820,3742
4,in that manner,81,2587
4,I have discovered,81,606
4,to remember what,83,3398
4,sort of a,83,3209
4,a fire I,83,3072
4,At the Rijksmuseum,84,3437
4,The Night Watch,84,3213,3214
4,I was keeping,84,158
4,I intended to,85,833
4,since there is,85,2466,2565
4,there is one,85,526,3223
4,at the Prado,85,180,1344
4,wished to see,85,3117
4,I switched to,85,1648
4,car that was,85,979
4,back in the,85,1247
4,I had actually,86,747,2875,3723
4,in those days,87,308,394,757,1659,2163,3224,3511,3512
4,come upon a,87,2658
4,of them I,87,2734,3256
4,to the bottom,87,756
4,of them would,88,3119
4,Several of them,89,1940
4,John Keats died,89,90
4,on the house,90,590
4,In the Iliad,93,725,1988,2165,3058,3079
4,it was at,93,3436,3670
4,was at one,93,359
4,at one time,93,577,869,2059
4,I was almost,94,1132
4,let myself think,94,409
4,harmless enough to,95,1342
4,to consider it,96,1231
4,for instance Even,96,2338
4,Even though the,96,963,1501,1586,2199
4,the sky was,96,3677
4,water from my,99,3336
4,which is perhaps,99,665,1524,1796,2370,2447,2452
4,is perhaps a,99,826
4,too Even if,100,888,1513,2493,3177
4,it is hardly,100,1401
4,is hardly the,100,3618
4,bring in my,101,1100
4,water from the,101,1698
4,able to do,101,2823
4,for a long,101,1077
4,a long while,101,2694
4,one could drink,102,106
4,when I lived,102,178
4,at the Uffizi,102,3450
4,when I would,102,1806,1824
4,as generators for,104,2669
4,not remember which,106,1273
4,becoming adept at,106,107
4,of that sort,106,3057,3285,3791
4,I have burned,107,1230
4,over the years,107,139
4,I have noted,108,1305,1419
4,I would rather,109,1977
4,That was in,110,1741
4,Well it was,111,1041
4,to stay on,111,3112
4,stay on for,111,3574
4,gasoline all over,112,3523
4,Much of the,113,733
4,I could still,113,3603
4,see the smoke,113,1417
4,Now I have,114,270,579
4,house by the,114,824
4,quite fond of,115,3775
4,at which I,118,1289
4,It is a,120,563,656,678,1611,1884,2372,2664,2682,2913,3745,3779
4,although I have,120,567,607,655,1247,1513,1673,1890,1924,2463,3732
4,get rid of,121,352,1353
4,is what I,122,1239,2008
4,one happens to,123,2889
4,Still perhaps there,127,2574
4,perhaps there is,127,439,506
4,I had left,127,1100
4,Of a sort,128,200,1407
4,was speaking about,132,3401
4,of the baggage,136,1116
4,there are still,137,224
4,I should perhaps,138,1375,2778,2803
4,that there are,138,581,1127,2375,2546
4,there are eight,138,788
4,the house although,138,2668
4,two or three,138,262
4,Actually I did,139,1539,2594
4,Aeschylus and Sophocles,141,3100
4,In a different,143,2592,3208
4,Helen and Clytemnestra,143,1283
4,and Clytemnestra and,143,2396
4,Clytemnestra and Electra,143,2793,3115
4,whom I did,143,3319
4,If I had,145,651,1091,1160,1174,1263,1423,1813,1881,2304,2595,2630,2723,3072,3228,3396,3470,3667
4,not have done,146,2236
4,have done it,146,426
4,it at all,146,1219
4,where it was,148,1131,3431
4,was after I,149,858
4,I had gone,149,1091,1099
4,had gone to,149,1627
4,to ancient Troy,149,150
4,which may have,149,3378
4,plays have been,150,2604
4,the Bering Strait,153,1083
4,I did seek,154,200
4,as well But,155,1762
4,across all of,156,372
4,ahead of me,156,1647
4,Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov,158,1307
4,Why do I,159,236,3013
4,quite possibly I,160,661,1079,3605
4,why did I,162,625
4,thought to the,162,1090,2555,3526
4,fact when I,164,3592
4,that they had,164,1060
4,to be in,164,707,1613,3499,3751
4,this instant that,165,3594
4,too of course,165,924,1283,1819,1971,2744,3189,3513
4,may be in,168,2537,3404
4,looking for Raskolnikov,169,170
4,one could also,171,596
4,for Anna Karenina,171,1293
4,just as readily,171,1808,2209,2338,2804
4,would I have,176,1754
4,And had been,177,1223
4,Even before I,177,710,2303,2900,3620
4,And so was,178,390
4,my period in,179,2870
4,In Madrid I,180,2085
4,I had thought,180,2488
4,but it was,180,1463
4,Only when the,182,1632
4,when the sun,182,598
4,to see that,182,599
4,in a hotel,184,2085,3040,3703
4,the one they,184,2995
4,not remember when,190,920
4,that I stopped,190,1308
4,I was on,191,444
4,Just imagine how,192,1135,1450,3632
4,But it had,194,614
4,before I went,195,3574
4,have said the,199,1220
4,Surely it is,199,2682,2733
4,burden myself with,200,396
4,as well although,201,1995
4,had begun to,203,2896,2900
4,Still when I,208,1220,2780
4,summers as now,209,2895
4,When it is,213,589,1744
4,When the leaves,214,328,2007
4,I can see,214,568,796,1811
4,or even to,214,906
4,to sleep in,218,1263
4,farther than I,221,614
4,walk in either,221,2892
4,is at the,223,791,2048,3354,3437
4,Sister Juana Ines,225,2629
4,have been to,225,3065
4,I would be,226,401,1578,1806,1929
4,I chose to,227,646
4,mean in the,228,3452
4,or Dylan Thomas,228,1117
4,come into mind,230,265
4,Actually I have,235,2348,3757
4,on the same,236,2326,2803
4,of books that,238,2838
4,books that I,238,648
4,down from the,240,1885
4,Odysseus was away,241,1571
4,And if it,242,1571
4,that husband of,242,3153
4,is in the,246,1273,1848,2383,2422
4,doing that is,246,3794
4,but in the,247,2811,3210
4,out that the,249,3106
4,they are not,250,3564
4,a cat in,253,371,3211,3406
4,of the cat,254,2146,3446
4,the cat was,254,359,368,2100,3273
4,I should have,255,3424
4,have also perhaps,255,2551
4,as somebody once,257,1113
4,once called her,257,3055
4,her After all,257,639
4,I am basically,258,287,3683
4,turn out to,258,2472
4,only a few,259,1615,2202
4,outside of the,260,950
4,In the Odyssey,262,726,1277,2442,3057,3134,3154,3207
4,as I did,263,1259,2243
4,There is still,267,1846
4,have been hearing,268,1551,3787
4,a portrait of,269,1043,2246
4,And now I,270,1514
4,I have the,270,2536,2713
4,But it is,270,2188,2583
4,that I can,270,794,1258,3231
4,not have made,272,1206
4,under the circumstances,273,442
4,do not speak,276,1218
4,not remember anything,277,2403
4,my father 's,277,325,2647
4,any of my,282,1065
4,may have gotten,282,2562
4,no less than,283,1391,2652
4,that In the,286,791,1885,3376
4,where I had,286,305,880,1758
4,had once lived,286,1481
4,Once in a,290,409
4,the death of,291,2327
4,after Agamemnon had,291,634
4,somebody once said,293,1113
4,so that any,294,830
4,Well and in,296,319,1193
4,for such a,301,3640
4,may have thought,302,546
4,have thought to,302,3136
4,it was actually,304,2232,2897,3376
4,that canvas up,304,764
4,I had done,307,1569
4,it to the,307,2533
4,Though I was,308,2102
4,And so had,308,748,1615,3187
4,thought about it,310,3016
4,Well all of,313,485,1164
4,of them when,313,1887
4,have been an,314,624
4,In fact she,315,3177
4,indicated that I,316,2855
4,while I still,316,3482
4,those final weeks,319,461
4,Though I have,321,478,1610,2382,2414,3750
4,the projector I,321,1452
4,I brought in,322,1409,2410
4,number on the,322,2371
4,that was how,324,2083
4,My aunt Esther,325,2644,3718
4,at least there,326,624
4,there is always,326,1317,2466
4,is always a,326,2039
4,strand of tape,327,536
4,had not yet,331,3274
4,Well and for,333,2917
4,for a period,333,3040
4,also on a,333,793
4,I once read,334,800,1543,2690
4,it was in,335,3240
4,was in The,335,528,1383,1731,2308,2736
4,was a painter,336,3387
4,a painter and,336,2156,2160
4,and not a,336,1522
4,of its own,339,2628
4,I would set,342,342
4,them all over,342,1298
4,in that case,342,548,815,1414,2493
4,case I would,342,3259
4,This was before,343,1963
4,I had learned,343,2482
4,is an atlas,349,528
4,I have stopped,349,1456,2659
4,was some time,355,2855
4,the connection between,356,2243,2631
4,that I saw,357,1143,2779
4,I saw a,357,1966
4,And the reason,358,2813
4,the reason I,358,1532,1753,2383,2558,2771,2772,2834
4,reason I am,358,2296
4,is because it,358,2383,2413,2813
4,that the cat,365,2106,2108,3179,3273
4,generator and floodlights,365,898
4,if the cat,366,927
4,the cat had,366,2108
4,with a cat,371,3448
4,called the cat,375,2127,3508
4,after a time,375,2253,2498
4,a time when,375,1620
4,struck me that,375,2390,2662
4,me that I,375,798,1295
4,that I should,375,3357
4,the seagull which,377,2746
4,I was undeniably,379,947
4,And so I,379,1201
4,seen the seagull,380,383
4,I had finally,382,386
4,gotten accustomed to,382,3304
4,Still I would,383,1977
4,believe I had,383,2533
4,was much more,384,1293
4,more probably the,384,2850
4,that reminded me,388,1510
4,no idea if,389,934
4,I drove a,390,2533
4,each time I,390,1097,1910,2891
4,made use of,391,784,870,1087
4,What with having,392,2274
4,at so many,392,1559
4,ran out of,392,3589
4,had come to,393,2746
4,of which I,394,2831,2880
4,troubled to transfer,394,782
4,of my baggage,394,2669
4,as well in,394,3701
4,of the same,396,1002,1008,1725
4,in no time,396,2119,3298
4,Here I have,397,1641
4,at the moment,398,947,1162,1882,2355,3444
4,out at the,400,675,1387
4,at the spring,400,1100,1189,1358,2555,2895,3753
4,to see it,401,514
4,was russet colored,402,2113
4,Actually it was,404,1121,1357,1705
4,one of those,405,493,667,814,1005,1374,1657,2645,2693,3296
4,I almost always,405,702
4,in from the,407,1299
4,For instance I,410,1459
4,in a book,412,2799
4,The cat that,414,2184,2359,3400,3508
4,put into the,414,2814,2822
4,since it is,418,582,3044
4,Well it is,419,688,1010,2188,2342
4,and had a,419,1312
4,night 's sleep,419,842
4,have noted that,420,1305
4,I went into,421,456
4,went into the,421,3109
4,into the kitchen,421,3336
4,I went upstairs,421,2649
4,It is about,422,2047
4,time I had,422,947,1686,2595,3744
4,I have done,426,2525,3730,3783
4,on a road,427,1653
4,in La Mancha,427,551,1459,2494
4,I kept on,427,1267,2893
4,that I never,427,3392
4,any closer to,427,428
4,to the castle,428,549,1467,3802
4,and that the,429,3248
4,Very likely one,430,1451
4,is not in,433,3569,3749
4,the embankment had,434,1059
4,been watching the,435,1327
4,I understood that,442,1371,1392,1638,1865
4,of the car,444,1138
4,mean on the,445,2627
4,And with the,445,1292,3748
4,of a car,446,1645
4,I was driving,446,456,1631,1682
4,it had not,451,614,1631,3274
4,me in the,451,1591
4,was that it,452,1552,2811,3602
4,it did not,452,875,1143,1145
4,the embankment and,453,981
4,could see the,453,1417
4,driving into Italy,456,456
4,at one 's,456,3596
4,Doubtless it is,458,1728,2077,2693,2701,2889
4,partly age which,458,2701
4,could actually be,459,827
4,the mirror is,460,475
4,on that same,461,862,3588
4,Actually there was,464,1203
4,when I came,464,787,1098,2793
4,is in fact,464,1247
4,house although it,465,2668
4,because it was,466,1561,2202,3036
4,at the house,466,3535
4,the painting into,467,3744
4,time I did,467,3139
4,I did so,467,2624
4,believed it was,468,1052
4,not go back,469,558
4,not feel like,471,1069
4,fluffy cottonwood seeds,472,1531,3556

4,of those were,480,1205
4,was no longer,482,864,947
4,are now in,485,2360
4,that would be,489,823,908,3631
4,Well and a,490,2167
4,a number of,490,783,1795,2547
4,number of them,490,1154,2633,3256
4,had never been,490,1606,1770,2100,3742
4,again when I,491,3686
4,in group shows,492,3315

4,who built the,500,625
4,to that same,500,993
4,a perfect circle,502,1341

4,one book in,526,707
4,house which I,526,1009,2557,3752
4,since I came,526,1180
4,one could say,527,2805
4,since it was,527,1531
4,edition of the,527,1840,2600,2819
4,Although where I,528,1751
4,The only book,528,2606
4,I have looked,528,1403
4,did that not,529,2232
4,not ten minutes,529,544
4,Which I now,530,1359
4,can not be,530,660,1107,2293
4,was on a,530,1682,1751
4,way that it,530,2932
4,it has become,530,1242
4,become permanently misshapen,530,813,3746
4,Presumably it was,531,743
4,was singing The,533,1783
4,I was once,534,1622,1623,2608
4,recording of The,535,2955
4,name a seagull,537,2765
4,the Greek plays,538,1486,2604
4,they had been,538,2379
4,to be quite,539,2037,3775
4,that if he,540,1461
4,if he could,540,3000
4,did not seem,540,1056,2614
4,that the translator,541,1576
4,I burned that,543,1250
4,it in the,543,1649,1961,2902
4,the pages of,543,1845
4,I had finished,543,947
4,their reverse sides,543,1308
4,why I would,544,1206,1823
4,I had set,544,879,2119
4,earlier that I,544,1695
4,next to the,544,1886
4,the painting was,544,3748
4,Certain questions would,545,844
4,Such as in,546,916
4,father may have,546,2066
4,into the mirror,546,1032
4,would have ever,547,2153,3166
4,one continued to,547,3554
4,In a Jeep,550,3510
4,also of course,551,1449,2093,2796,3625
4,hears of him,553,555
4,spoken of as,553,555
4,as if he,553,1569
4,if he were,553,2278
4,artists such as,554,556
4,that one hears,554,1873
4,Theophanes the Greek,556,1468,2975,3402
4,directly descended from,557,1511,1519
4,than that to,558,2994
4,to somebody like,558,1520
4,why not ?,558,667
4,had at least,559,2150
4,at least one,559,886,1518,2586
4,to be of,560,1663
4,appears to be,561,2825
4,to be somebody,561,2239
4,the very window,561,596
4,so that there,563,3769
4,there is little,563,1112
4,lurking at my,564,633
4,and so could,567,3641
4,the person was,567,2804
4,but in my,567,2527
4,to where I,568,1841
4,something else in,569,1806
4,from the front,570,1911
4,the front deck,570,2891
4,such as that,572,2329
4,if I could,573,3481
4,I have made,579,1087,3540
4,have made the,579,3228
4,because of my,579,3466
4,it being a,579,1604
4,that there must,580,3769
4,of them in,580,2829
4,them in the,580,1669
4,house as well,581,3562
4,the woman at,581,583
4,be at the,582,820,1882
4,in the canvas,582,587
4,next one is,583,2048
4,that the woman,584,3667
4,may well be,584,2125
4,well be a,584,2702
4,So that perhaps,585,835,983,2563
4,perhaps she was,586,1577
4,Possibly there is,587,2632
4,At four o'clock,588,599,641,689
4,there being no,589,951,1820
4,will have to,590,1072
4,have to do,590,2109
4,the real shadows,590,591
4,when I go,591,2903,3685
4,Perhaps I will,592,817,2759,3736,3737
4,which made it,594,2118
4,even more so,595,2169
4,Which was in,597,778
4,in a street,597,2065
4,had gotten to,598,1232,2807,3119,3775
4,in fact even,600,2303,2762
4,fact even though,600,3186
4,they were all,600,3266
4,had lived in,601,2482,2482
4,long enough to,601,1710
4,enough to have,601,1430
4,to have gotten,601,780
4,As in the,602,916,2322,2417
4,was the only,603,2223,2811
4,I know that,604,2314,2675
4,that he did,605,2264,2931
4,Beyond the breakers,609,1090
4,of the work,609,1208
4,than I had,614,3031
4,would scarcely be,615,2586
4,that ketch in,616,1165
4,in the Aegean,616,1586
4,to believe it,617,1342
4,believe it has,617,2661
4,say or to,617,866,2790,2793
4,not remember the,619,2365,2660
4,the street with,619,630,2998
4,taverns in it,619,630
4,of any of,620,2653
4,the streets in,620,3005
4,to conceive of,622,1867,1997
4,in that regard,622,1081,1475
4,for instance Or,623,1653,2571,3603
4,So that one,627,791,2908,2926
4,am I now,628,1824
4,singing birds sweet,628,3718
4,the people to,628,3366
4,people to eat,628,883
4,a street in,631,639
4,Well and especially,632,1680
4,the notion of,633,1090,1969,2442,3105
4,the painting that,633,1822
4,make this connection,633,3229
4,where one is,634,740
4,things of course,636,2918
4,to lurk at,636,3130
4,after all obviously,639,3762
4,which was a,642,709,1344
4,where I saw,645,1290
4,have been in,645,3540
4,been in a,645,1121,1759,2592
4,in a bookstore,645,1132
4,The one with,646,2943
4,with the books,646,2584
4,of them were,648,2245,2572,2742,3204
4,I had even,648,3278
4,William Shakespeare 's,649,1985
4,shot holes into,651,2943
4,there at the,652,3535
4,letting one 's,653,684
4,on the street,654,2251
4,by people with,659,2445
4,since I am,660,1812
4,put it back,661,2650
4,it back into,661,3218
4,have verified that,663,1421
4,the pages from,663,1309,2446
4,people who were,666,3301,3312
4,with each other,666,669,3663
4,each other in,666,2496
4,of whom were,666,3700
4,the painter was,668,1005
4,Very possibly this,669,2683
4,the house itself,671,1209
4,have been there,671,1649,3597
4,would have felt,675,2906,3102
4,would have heard,676,2149,2730
4,Kirsten Flagstad singing,677,3345
4,Winters when the,678,1192
4,is a little,678,918
4,that one is,681,948,964,2887
4,the entire world,683,3679
4,a window or,684,3130
4,whom I had,685,3366
4,of Richard Strauss,689,1902
4,! And here,691,760,2972
4,that one afternoon,695,1755
4,veil of madness,696,712
4,you do not,698,1549,2683
4,I ran into,699,2946
4,also had a,701,1673
4,Well when I,702,1388,2609
4,book in the,707,1610
4,that one did,707,838,2481
4,did happen to,707,2561
4,This was a,708,1336,2204,2619,3023
4,the car that,709,1137
4,of at the,709,2019
4,I now believe,710,3242
4,counterclockwise among mountains,713,1682
4,to look into,714,2229
4,have told me,714,1701
4,me about seagulls,714,1687
4,got my period,715,2870
4,had made me,718,3578
4,I still do,722,2661
4,or in any,725,1308,2584,3674
4,did not write,726,3260
4,that after all,726,1640,3398
4,Before I was,727,3218,3583
4,should remind me,735,1295
4,having my period,735,1921,1922
4,no way whatsoever,740,3624
4,I had believed,741,1683
4,believed I was,741,3419
4,since there were,742,2874
4,to rise up,743,743
4,in front of,743,1077,1148,2061
4,And then to,743,2799,3555
4,when I had,747,879,1575,2594,3214,3528
4,it does not,750,2209,2355,2531,3648
4,All of these,755,1127,1153,1740,2490,2507,3257
4,first aid items,755,976
4,rather than to,756,1214
4,antiquities to the,760,2972
4,To paint on,765,2951
4,after not having,766,3328
4,I had had,768,880,1332,1881
4,hearing the Four,771,3419
4,Though I am,772,960
4,thinking about the,772,964,1120,2200,2833
4,by Richard Strauss,772,2720
4,of the vehicles,774,1782
4,to me to,775,3082,3281
4,Assuming one had,777,3680
4,a key in,777,1784
4,one was generally,779,2689
4,a hand truck,782,786,2546
4,a Land Rover,784,1614,2533
4,one of my,787,855,1288,2933
4,Rather it was,787,2860
4,The hand truck,789,818,2545
4,badly rusted as,789,818
4,The basement is,790,791,2557
4,the house I,790,1386
4,the house and,791,1201,3109
4,a sandy embankment,791,2557
4,There are several,793,1079,2546
4,on a ledge,793,2547
4,although there is,794,2021,2486,3223,3607,3692
4,ever having been,794,1121,3575
4,now that it,796,2133
4,reminds me that,798,3003
4,convinced that the,798,2868
4,was written by,798,801,1603,1616
4,however which I,800,2594
4,which I mention,800,2409
4,able to remember,800,3472,3487
4,it is that,800,1102,2879
4,book called the,801,2616,2616
4,that this is,802,1474,2694
4,which is why,802,3220
4,where I came,804,1841
4,anxiety in it,806,2182,2418
4,I am only,807,3117
4,standing askew And,813,1852
4,of one of,814,1622,3337
4,one is at,815,2048
4,curious about the,815,969
4,the meaning of,815,3348
4,of the title,815,2708,2786
4,I must admit,815,2618
4,in the town,820,1074
4,beneath the Acropolis,821,1683
4,nothing more than,827,1407
4,all that is,828,1767
4,is really in,828,2416
4,in that same,829,3233
4,about the person,830,896
4,now appear to,830,3170
4,become convinced that,831,3641
4,I may possibly,833,2415
4,One can scarcely,837,1787
4,about a person,837,840
4,when there is,837,950,1421
4,is no person,837,953
4,Two days ago,839,993
4,hearing Kathleen Ferrier,839,2672
4,put the painting,841,1848,3744
4,I mention that,843,2258
4,that this time,843,3294
4,what would be,846,3032
4,Especially since the,850,1451
4,a drawing by,852,1582
4,it is connected,853,3417
4,remember that he,854,3698
4,The reason for,855,2146,2813,3378
4,being at the,855,1782
4,When I stopped,858,1105
4,as it happened,862,977,1159,1631,1656,2707,2772,3369
4,that is perhaps,862,1998
4,when one 's,863,3648
4,there it was,864,2899
4,it was no,864,2215
4,to believe that,865,1279,1343,1729,3101
4,could well have,867,911
4,Doubtless the stick,869,878
4,however because of,869,1053
4,I have even,871,1016,1441,2605
4,have even written,871,1725,3255
4,nothing that I,876,1314
4,that I wrote,876,3244,3257
4,Still if I,877,1174
4,was not even,877,3245
4,a piece of,879,2186
4,however where I,880,2713
4,my mind until,881,1119
4,until I was,881,2897
4,I was already,881,1105
4,of looking back,881,1361
4,things that I,882,2479
4,thought up a,887,3205
4,at least once,888,2150,2220,3105,3464
4,Rembrandt 's pupils,889,895,923,2210
4,although I am,889,1194,1315,1486,1691,1916,2548,3415
4,as to why,889,1785,2847,2914,3390
4,the whole thing,892,1104
4,just to see,892,3019,3776
4,Rupert Brooke died,893,1585
4,that Rembrandt 's,895,901
4,Or rather what,896,2749,3382
4,talking about the,896,3192
4,who is not,896,1728
4,having only been,897,1359
4,Which did not,898,1053
4,after having gotten,899,1840
4,strolled right past,900,3186
4,The world being,903,2688
4,playing tricks on,903,905
4,line of work,904,2155,2240
4,the Greeks had,908,3051
4,the same stick,910,2319
4,ran off with,912,1950
4,Though it is,913,2364
4,that Sappho had,914,1518
4,Helen is shown,916,3155
4,that she would,919,3647
4,Possibly there are,920,2840
4,by her in,920,1005
4,no longer being,921,1009,3457
4,was once a,922,928
4,was raped too,924,2516
4,Doubtless there is,925,1337
4,Naturally I had,927,2073
4,knowing if the,927,1065
4,playing the piano,929,1967
4,In fact Brahms,930,1795
4,visited in Paris,934,938
4,at that time,936,3526
4,How one remembers,937,940
4,handled my stick,941,1428
4,Then again one,942,1402,1856,3557
4,made people burn,942,1339
4,a baseball player,944,2800
4,is perhaps not,946,2137,2235
4,perhaps not the,946,3322
4,thinking about him,947,1893
4,is thinking about,948,3583
4,thinking about one,948,963,1824
4,to write about,949,2321,3602
4,the sentence I,949,1216,1876
4,the broken window,950,2114
4,was not actually,951,2787,3283
4,As there were,952,2838
4,there were no,952,1095,1437,1764,1973,2652
4,a house in,954,1005
4,wish to carry,954,1101
4,this is the,956,1279
4,some sort of,956,1249,1604,1650,1842
4,one would scarcely,957,2207,2586
4,fact that there,958,1471
4,Nor am I,962,1359,2470
4,typing that sentence,963,1575
4,Possibly I should,966,1274
4,thinking about in,967,1475
4,I have possibly,968,3509
4,given that impression,968,2651
4,put it up,969,970
4,since I can,970,1424
4,I can even,971,1354,3116
4,into the Mediterranean,976,2533
4,fact what it,980,1031
4,in fact what,981,1031,1386,1798,3102,3137,3242
4,my having been,981,3487
4,having been in,981,1121,1768,2494,3227
4,not long before,981,1845
4,and listened to,981,2962
4,Even if the,985,1589,1688,2624,2990,3449
4,read a book,990,2665
4,so badly damaged,990,2570
4,number of books,991,1005
4,books in this,991,3421
4,all of them,991,3267
4,the atlas has,992,2834
4,The book about,994,1487,2495
4,there does not,995,2836
4,does not appear,995,2355
4,My reason for,996,1138,2484,2621,3036
4,this is not,996,1474,1775,1789,1888,2491,2792,3263
4,to have lived,996,1720
4,Then again the,997,1156,1278,2146,2871
4,a guest In,997,1005
4,have been done,997,1340
4,paintings by the,999,2534
4,that they are,1000,2508,3564
4,they are in,1000,1290
4,doors which I,1000,1001
4,some time ago,1000,1531,2855
4,I any longer,1001,1359
4,the one to,1001,3490
4,one to the,1001,1128
4,the walls of,1002,2675
4,a beach as,1003,2586
4,that the other,1003,1413,1884
4,the other two,1003,2974
4,making such a,1004,3602
4,is that the,1005,1221,1478,1531,2427,2859,3102,3785
4,likely was somebody,1005,2805
4,was somebody who,1005,1579
4,explain why there,1005,2836
4,in which there,1005,3414
4,the people who,1006,2001,2809,3301,3357
4,been delighted to,1006,1735,3121
4,even the very,1009,3574
4,even though it,1009,2364,3377
4,of it I,1011,1371
4,it as a,1011,2773,3274,3759
4,taking my walks,1011,2018
4,None of the,1013,1485
4,of the three,1013,3346
4,but I am,1014,1925,2374
4,it is something,1015,2414
4,I believe that,1017,1332,2220,2532,3403
4,believe that there,1017,2918
4,that there might,1017,3763
4,of a painting,1017,3752
4,so they would,1019,1956
4,have been because,1022,2484
4,because he was,1022,3703
4,it has also,1031,1038
4,that I will,1032,1395
4,I will see,1032,1033
4,looking back at,1032,1930
4,Naturally I will,1033,1242
4,In other words,1034,1437,2428
4,is quite ordinary,1035,1399
4,heredity being heredity,1036,3564
4,to realize that,1038,3374
4,I may be,1038,3404
4,when I painted,1040,2109
4,Though I rarely,1042,1081
4,regretted that I,1043,1085
4,it was their,1045,1046
4,which I could,1048,2712
4,was known to,1052,2061
4,would have believed,1052,1114
4,did not keep,1053,1700
4,beginning to deteriorate,1053,2904
4,Leonardo 's own,1053,2344
4,because of a,1053,2404
4,it was still,1054,1141
4,of this has,1055,1802
4,that so many,1056,2572
4,people did not,1056,1737,2343
4,not seem to,1056,3398
4,know that The,1056,2314
4,case on my,1057,1351
4,way I have,1059,3331
4,a mirror to,1060,2908
4,the image of,1061,2909,3525
4,so many things,1065,2472
4,on the table,1068,2650
4,was going to,1071,1141,1702,2333,2677
4,going to the,1071,3401
4,On the way,1072,1991
4,is hardly a,1073,2429
4,I looked at,1074,2577
4,looked at the,1074,3208
4,I also realized,1075,3602
4,what they really,1076,1974
4,is that everybody,1076,1967
4,that everybody in,1076,1834
4,everybody in the,1076,1834,3297
4,period in the,1077,2870
4,either of them,1078,2267
4,Though I did,1090,2533,3509
4,I did give,1090,3398
4,one might have,1092,1322,1451,2905
4,might have actually,1092,3431
4,as to where,1092,1841
4,to where one,1092,2968
4,out of sight,1092,1143
4,been seeing the,1092,1093
4,say that one,1093,2805
4,would have then,1093,2616
4,so to speak,1093,2901,2910
4,not even the,1094,3245
4,but only an,1094,3468
4,image of the,1094,3525
4,of the fire,1094,2416,2427,2427
4,Possibly there were,1095,2731
4,had a rowboat,1096,1420
4,that the new,1097,1615
4,explain why I,1100,1318
4,of what one,1101,2909
4,not remember it,1102,3450
4,I am feeling,1102,1103,3727,3798
4,perhaps what I,1104,1327,3465
4,a kind of,1104,1304,2025,2237,2347
4,I have already,1106,1889,1973,2934,3724
4,feel this way,1106,1109
4,If there was,1108,2244,2696
4,was something I,1108,2489
4,doubtless it would,1108,1308,1976,3176
4,most of such,1114,1342
4,other sort of,1114,1120
4,one would appear,1116,2529,2916
4,no idea who,1118,1575
4,although in this,1119,1333
4,Obviously I was,1120,3316
4,was Martin Heidegger,1123,3229
4,by Kierkegaard or,1124,1124
4,not even one,1125,3629
4,Anna Akhmatova is,1126,3619
4,there are books,1127,2840
4,I have noticed,1128,1485
4,As well as,1128,2351,2528,2546
4,being simply that,1130,3257
4,event I have,1131,1919
4,Perhaps I was,1134,3517,3728
4,was reading the,1134,2790
4,day before I,1136,2555
4,the car was,1138,1141
4,was to look,1138,2561
4,to look for,1138,3637
4,Unquestionably it was,1141,3059
4,that what the,1141,2312
4,something else altogether,1142,1251
4,anything at all,1143,2984
4,All I am,1144,1832,2745
4,of these years,1153,3479
4,doing exactly that,1154,1231
4,but a certain,1155,1538
4,the tires on,1156,1183,2006
4,to see which,1157,1169
4,which of the,1157,2355,3686
4,the taxi had,1157,1168
4,I appeared to,1162,1306
4,to be more,1162,3031
4,more interested in,1162,1293,2633
4,in at the,1162,1420
4,I was doubtless,1165,1642
4,by that ketch,1165,3091
4,and had not,1167,2708
4,gone into the,1169,1781
4,was lying on,1169,3746
4,in fact was,1170,3605
4,at all but,1170,1930,3468
4,chapter on Brahms,1171,1172
4,been more than,1172,1355
4,about dancing girls,1173,1224
4,forced to think,1175,3279
4,of course it,1175,3306
4,not a car,1175,1176
4,been in the,1180,2686,3540
4,in the identical,1180,1247,1731,1848
4,came to this,1180,1370
4,what with all,1181,3788
4,all four of,1181,3116
4,out to the,1186,2768,3794
4,is next to,1187,1495
4,which is how,1187,2392,3049
4,I think of,1187,1210,1634
4,think of the,1187,1210
4,standing in the,1188,1636
4,the only other,1192,1727,2811
4,which is still,1194,2836
4,is still another,1194,1846
4,can be seen,1194,1376
4,not make a,1199,3385
4,out of it,1199,2999
4,adequate firewood here,1203,1204
4,although I can,1206,1888,2290
4,made this connection,1206,3231
4,at all In,1207,1219,1838,2400,3376
4,all In fact,1207,2575
4,for any of,1208,2678
4,I took from,1208,2731
4,Well there is,1209,2667
4,the case with,1214,2584,3251,3322
4,to have had,1217,2940
4,it in my,1217,2889
4,about was the,1218,2939
4,was the word,1218,2655
4,the word bricolage,1218,1220
4,Well perhaps I,1219,1865,1889
4,for my walk,1220,1528
4,I sometimes do,1220,2855
4,I must have,1220,3479,3481
4,one 's reading,1223,2658
4,of music that,1223,3662
4,Not knowing that,1225,3065
4,to become the,1226,1589
4,But I have,1229,3222
4,and that it,1231,1624
4,enough to be,1231,1593,2017
4,Robert Rauschenberg had,1232,2145
4,I will think,1233,2128,3445
4,such things as,1235,1381,1397,2669,2669,3638
4,they are no,1235,2885
4,a second floor,1238,3325
4,what I will,1239,3389
4,I will more,1239,3798
4,I will have,1242,1384
4,even if in,1243,2493,3056
4,I have scarcely,1247,1748
4,which is in,1247,1877
4,which I have,1247,2668,2831,2929,3753
4,As often as,1248,3323
4,as it has,1248,2572
4,night that I,1250,1251
4,become aware of,1251,1371
4,aware of the,1251,1370,2362
4,which is something,1251,2915
4,Very possibly the,1252,3380
4,since I had,1252,2525,3745
4,to point out,1253,3223
4,how one 's,1253,2646
4,One morning I,1254,1381
4,I was similarly,1254,2739
4,in a car,1255,1263
4,understood that I,1255,1392,2203
4,It was some,1257,2855
4,I remembered that,1257,2483
4,before I believe,1257,1419
4,I can almost,1258,1994
4,practically right beside,1260,1262
4,the frame from,1264,3217
4,The latter was,1267,3746
4,day after day,1267,1267
4,I read about,1268,1592
4,was a book,1268,2713
4,this was by,1270,3302
4,while he was,1270,2317,3411,3442
4,also I believe,1272,1311
4,I believe The,1272,2602,3741
4,being what he,1272,1878
4,were the same,1274,2696
4,Well doubtless they,1275,1786
4,to come home,1277,3144
4,to visit Helen,1277,3116,3150
4,the little boy,1278,1286
4,by then it,1278,2893
4,is the same,1279,2389
4,I believe one,1280,1579
4,of it myself,1280,2274
4,of a single,1288,2404
4,of my lovers,1288,3586
4,are in the,1289,2352
4,in the Hermitage,1289,2870
4,them on the,1290,2762
4,on the very,1290,1683
4,not in my,1291,3569
4,Which would have,1292,2819,2992,3401,3468
4,would have made,1292,3228
4,since I was,1293,1323
4,looking at the,1293,2643
4,had a certain,1297,2734
4,Piero della Francesca,1297,1344,2057
4,all over the,1298,2675
4,of the water,1299,1400
4,I had brought,1299,1452
4,from the spring,1299,2558
4,This is because,1301,1559,2413
4,of that same,1302,3188,3618
4,having thought about,1303,2635,2795,3573
4,to be made,1304,2840
4,the way the,1304,3096
4,been much more,1304,2271
4,One day I,1306,1324,1324,1351,1351
4,have finally stopped,1306,2896
4,of Anna Akhmatova,1307,2571
4,perhaps this was,1307,1336,1769
4,same time that,1308,3107,3306
4,time that I,1308,2984,3415
4,I stopped reading,1308,2729
4,where he was,1310,2497
4,in fact who,1311,2838
4,William Gaddis who,1312,3287
4,lived for a,1312,3040
4,if it had,1313,2119,3233,3460
4,to have let,1315,2002
4,gone out for,1316,3015
4,my wraparound denim,1321,1669
4,I was even,1323,3217
4,had not even,1326,1615,3081
4,what I finally,1327,1382
4,that Leonardo did,1332,1337
4,Leonardo did not,1332,1957
4,had in mind,1332,1384,2098
4,did not paint,1333,1463,2426
4,either of those,1333,1887,2672,3692
4,so may have,1333,2484,2624
4,did not do,1334,2124
4,that Michelangelo once,1335,3023
4,Michelangelo once said,1335,2027
4,When he said,1335,2683
4,told him that,1335,1559
4,the Sistine Chapel,1335,2127
4,is something that,1337,2414
4,once threatened to,1338,2676
4,would have perhaps,1338,3133
4,was only one,1339,2771
4,would be pleased,1339,1578
4,of these things,1340,1740
4,done or said,1340,1340
4,it was similarly,1341,2344
4,once painted a,1341,2696,2929
4,Piero di Cosimo,1343,1344,1621,2057,2062,3718
4,many more people,1347,3224
4,'s ear is,1349,2368
4,lurking at windows,1350,2403,3109
4,remain the case,1351,2659
4,is that one,1351,1832,1873,2934
4,that one day,1351,2333
4,Conversely I can,1354,1831
4,call to mind,1354,1831
4,about Achilles and,1355,2308
4,quoted Friedrich Nietzsche,1356,1357
4,it was almost,1357,1993
4,Friedrich Nietzsche who,1357,3394
4,Where I have,1358,2713
4,time I decided,1358,2891
4,Or about certain,1361,3586
4,or two before,1364,2469
4,of that one,1365,1570,2362
4,is not the,1365,1775,2416
4,not the one,1365,3316
4,house which is,1366,2836
4,some distance from,1366,1630
4,All one can,1369,2221
4,upper rear window,1369,1376
4,not aware of,1370,1465
4,Once I did,1371,1595,2774,2844
4,understood that there,1371,1696
4,and for the,1372,3750
4,it what I,1373,3342
4,not on the,1374,1535,3322
4,that at all,1375,1694,2380,3072
4,it is in,1376,2383
4,be seen from,1376,1414
4,to become a,1378,2160,3277
4,said to myself,1379,2688,3328,3342
4,I finally determined,1381,1382
4,to make a,1381,2536
4,of doing so,1381,2889
4,I had put,1381,3744
4,was what I,1382,1774
4,this was in,1383,2202
4,the woods to,1383,1400
4,have also walked,1384,3751
4,told myself was,1386,3592
4,follow the road,1386,3510
4,to fret over,1390,2059
4,interest in the,1392,1393
4,This is a,1396,1405,1407,2694
4,being the only,1400,2606,2932
4,in the vicinity,1400,2339
4,for people who,1400,3251
4,see if one,1404,2417
4,my own house,1404,3326
4,should one be,1407,1408
4,to see one,1408,2904
4,the Rijksmuseum I,1409,3437
4,told me to,1409,1701
4,that the two,1409,3169
4,Well or the,1411,2522
4,be any way,1412,2814
4,if there were,1413,1437,1471,2572,3216
4,being exactly the,1413,2979
4,exactly the same,1413,3006
4,from the other,1413,1414
4,Although in that,1414,3501
4,might at least,1414,2214
4,my potbellied stove,1416,3326,3793
4,thought when I,1418,3528
4,in a painting,1421,1818
4,that the poster,1426,1531
4,may have spoken,1427,2260
4,the poster had,1428,1531
4,either as it,1429,1631
4,in which she,1430,3560
4,Well doubtless I,1435,1644,2281,2892
4,doubtless I could,1435,1925
4,this there being,1435,1544
4,thought about The,1440,3588
4,William Gaddis himself,1441,3355
4,seen William Gaddis,1441,1442
4,scene in The,1445,1711
4,boy over the,1445,1589
4,she was the,1449,1577
4,without ever having,1451,3321,3431,3618
4,the part of,1453,1968
4,It is only,1456,1986,2984
4,to understand how,1458,2646
4,thinking about that,1459,1822,3721
4,when Achilles was,1460,2312
4,women so that,1460,3045
4,was that if,1461,2309,3592
4,if he himself,1461,2275
4,had to go,1461,1738,2463
4,it was Van,1463,1894
4,that Odysseus was,1465,1571
4,of was that,1465,1510
4,that Achilles had,1465,1565
4,aware of this,1466,2840
4,something else I,1468,2690,3339
4,about in that,1475,1946
4,the time of,1475,1868,1993
4,time of year,1475,2551

4,there is anything,1499,3134
4,of them could,1501,1552
4,of them even,1503,1956
4,that was only,1507,1995
4,was only a,1507,2202
4,What he was,1507,1878,3383
4,he was really,1507,2330
4,was really named,1507,1510
4,had once been,1509,2019
4,Plato 's pupil,1509,2162
4,that Cassandra was,1510,3108
4,this Even if,1511,1572,2818
4,of the Iliad,1511,3072,3135

4,Brahms would have,1523,2673
4,had only one,1523,3185
4,also happens to,1525,2813
4,happens to be,1525,1613,1730,1923,2812
4,which I imagine,1529,3032
4,What I do,1531,2205,2822,3421
4,wish to mention,1531,1532
4,I wish to,1532,3242,3477
4,this is that,1532,2621,2708,2894
4,still on the,1532,3676
4,way I was,1533,3686
4,had ever even,1533,2637
4,even been to,1533,3112
4,Where was my,1536,3326
4,when all I,1536,3580,3723
4,now forced to,1540,3079
4,to wonder if,1540,1624
4,may have even,1541,3255
4,that Ludwig Wittgenstein,1542,1543,1578,2682,2996,3441
4,Wittgenstein himself had,1543,2745
4,had never read,1543,2723
4,if one was,1546,2638
4,him after all,1547,2219
4,been hearing the,1551,3787
4,that most of,1552,3657
4,can see that,1553,1811
4,John Ruskin even,1556,3309
4,about John Ruskin,1556,2935
4,another of the,1557,3362
4,And what I,1558,2704
4,John Ruskin is,1558,2935
4,was sensible enough,1560,2279
4,that he had,1561,2247
4,no clothes on,1561,2889
4,had a mistress,1565,3451
4,Some of that,1565,2679,2680
4,that John Ruskin,1566,2934
4,the translator who,1569,1576
4,I hardly mean,1572,3582,3716
4,that I actually,1574,1889
4,is all of,1574,2032
4,Samuel Butler was,1574,1577
4,Even when I,1575,1806,1823
4,I still had,1575,3482
4,So now I,1576,2314
4,too many times,1576,2643
4,I know about,1578,1591,1612,2656,2662
4,even if they,1583,2885
4,in saying that,1585,3231
4,the latter is,1586,2022
4,up only because,1587,3184
4,the same island,1587,2326
4,over the walls,1589,2675
4,And after that,1590,2324,3717
4,of Helen 's,1590,3117
4,about Samuel Butler,1591,1841,1843
4,to be certain,1593,3284
4,to be at,1593,1882,3573
4,no pencils then,1607,1973
4,was in some,1608,2796
4,for instance one,1610,2888
4,connected to anything,1610,1998
4,is a translation,1610,1611
4,What it is,1611,2047,3417,3755
4,a translation of,1611,2611,2706,2793
4,that I now,1612,1730,3685
4,than the most,1612,2743
4,in which to,1612,3514
4,the opera about,1613,2403
4,I had only,1615,3214
4,by Luigi Cherubini,1616,1710
4,I do that,1617,2883
4,that because of,1617,2203
4,that Maria Callas,1617,2153
4,have mixed up,1618,1712
4,Well or as,1622,2928,3613
4,as Friedrich Nietzsche,1622,1625
4,Friedrich Nietzsche for,1622,2715
4,of Friedrich Nietzsche,1622,1625
4,to this same,1623,2237
4,would have naturally,1627,2147,2310
4,I truly did,1630,3452
4,turned upside down,1632,1635
4,begin to play,1632,1635
4,up to my,1636,1644
4,and I am,1641,2621
4,at all I,1641,3298
4,which is assuredly,1641,3529
4,to which I,1642,2668
4,to mention that,1644,3282,3288
4,I had also,1646,2078,2374
4,from where I,1654,2076
4,happened with the,1656,1810
4,Not that I,1659,2321,3726
4,Along with the,1661,2781,3357
4,of the postcards,1662,2534
4,that soccer shirt,1666,1907
4,my own garments,1667,1703
4,I waited for,1668,1703
4,The shirt was,1671,1676,1691
4,much too large,1671,1676
4,a numeral on,1673,3778
4,it although I,1673,1724
4,where it actually,1676,2528
4,because of how,1676,2624
4,and especially in,1680,2238
4,at all from,1683,2521
4,Why I had,1688,3592
4,was because of,1688,1769,2834
4,and I had,1690,2145
4,I had simply,1690,2216
4,had simply not,1690,2390,2729
4,positive about that,1694,3742
4,fact I had,1695,1771
4,that there could,1696,3079
4,there could be,1696,3624
4,of the additional,1700,3313
4,of the others,1701,1731,1917,2507
4,Then again doubtless,1702,2889
4,with nothing on,1704,1707
4,at all even,1704,1822
4,it was quite,1705,3078
4,as I remember,1705,3218
4,to understand that,1710,3519
4,Maria Callas was,1710,1817
4,Lucia di Lammermoor,1710,1792,2763
4,in the latter,1711,2710
4,to understand this,1711,2815
4,Van Gogh was,1716,1893,2061,2064,2181
4,once tried to,1716,2060
4,he could have,1725,2684
4,could have even,1725,1915
4,a little bell,1726,3297
4,had ever heard,1727,2733
4,In St. Petersburg,1729,1964
4,St. Petersburg when,1729,3013
4,when he finally,1729,3095,3192
4,to get there,1729,2012,2561
4,to be one,1730,2836
4,sentence that I,1730,2688,3020
4,I once underlined,1730,3020,3022
4,book in which,1731,2799
4,and which was,1731,3009,3485
4,beside her bed,1731,1866
4,finally forced to,1736,3279
4,he had said,1737,2520
4,had said that,1737,3667
4,that all of,1740,2337
4,at all lately,1748,2079
4,Joan Baez And,1749,3282
4,the tennis courts,1751,1752,1753,1758
4,I have had,1753,2463,3758
4,Nor would I,1754,2844
4,to play tennis,1755,1756
4,decided to hit,1758,1760
4,which is where,1758,1877
4,had been in,1759,2686,3315,3574
4,been in cans,1760,1768
4,One can hardly,1761,2477
4,The strings on,1762,1856
4,before as well,1764,2009
4,Or that one,1767,1982
4,of them is,1767,2025
4,more than that,1767,3268
4,of the tennis,1768,1855
4,just the other,1773,1810,1814
4,since what I,1775,1959
4,to be positive,1776,3742
4,as to what,1776,3035,3094
4,I had stopped,1778,2304
4,in certain vehicles,1780,2671
4,Had I been,1781,2592
4,would have gone,1781,2277
4,about starting the,1784,1784
4,I have often,1785,1927
4,that was what,1786,3270
4,down and saying,1787,1788
4,have refused to,1792,2926
4,my favorite composer,1793,1838
4,great a number,1795,2092
4,mentioned is a,1796,3449
4,fact what has,1798,2420
4,is surely not,1803,2138
4,for instance and,1809,3534
4,Jan Vermeer of,1815,1878
4,something wrong with,1819,1887
4,why I am,1821,3722
4,to see the,1821,3019
4,was why I,1823,3485
4,I now suddenly,1824,2961
4,a single painting,1827,2238
4,about Jan Steen,1831,3415
4,that all I,1832,3261
4,Or even if,1834,2433
4,also only now,1834,2808
4,as everybody in,1834,2507
4,painting called The,1835,2032
4,of them may,1835,2249
4,And doubtless it,1837,2019,3176
4,who decided to,1837,2160
4,On the front,1840,2891
4,turned on the,1840,2671
4,by Samuel Butler,1840,2615
4,Samuel Butler however,1843,2615
4,even in the,1843,3058
4,And doubtless I,1844,3588
4,attention to the,1845,2606
4,the identical room,1848,3745
4,to of course,1857,3533
4,should I wish,1859,3477
4,in my life,1863,3302
4,enraptured by baseball,1863,1867
4,I scarcely mean,1873,1900
4,that one will,1873,3522
4,said that the,1876,3667
4,and which is,1877,3094,3143,3155,3191,3479,3617,3684
4,what has now,1879,2420
4,can sincerely doubt,1880,1884
4,of the frame,1881,3217
4,back into place,1881,3218
4,the time to,1882,3376
4,sincerely doubt that,1884,2616
4,doubt that the,1884,2392
4,it is also,1885,2701,3066
4,the first of,1887,2361,2894
4,to worry about,1888,2994,2995
4,understand how one,1888,2646
4,being mad again,1891,3641
4,mad for a,1893,3513
4,a second time,1893,3392
4,case it was,1894,2706
4,having written to,1899,3594
4,I would perhaps,1900,1977
4,was even more,1904,3217
4,than Van Gogh,1904,3448
4,not conceive of,1906,1994
4,looked as if,1911,2174
4,have always said,1912,3342
4,One is scarcely,1918,2658
4,that But I,1925,3797
4,indicate them and,1926,2855
4,was at least,1928,2062,3670
4,doubtless if I,1929,2633,3072
4,I did look,1929,2594,3515
4,In fact without,1930,3618
4,about doing so,1930,3359
4,I would also,1934,2177
4,had eleven children,1934,1936
4,is that Vermeer,1937,2231
4,not seem like,1940,2614
4,are not even,1940,3564
4,at all although,1944,3481
4,solved the question,1945,2132
4,in his life,1949,2238,2911
4,ever let her,1950,3166
4,gave candy to,1952,1956,2682
4,may even have,1954,1980
4,fact quite possibly,1956,2993
4,would go away,1956,3009
4,been said about,1957,3248
4,so much for,1958,1959
4,with Clara Schumann,1959,1965
4,to reform Sien,1962,2061
4,I was a,1966,3387
4,Song of Love,1966,2736,3420
4,So perhaps it,1969,2735
4,even ill have,1970,2299
4,if I remember,1970,3418
4,Homer was blind,1971,1974
4,possibly this was,1972,2683
4,mentioned that there,1973,2546
4,that there were,1973,2712,2918
4,it was because,1974,2488
4,Well doubtless it,1976,2761
4,Emily Bronte did,1976,2123,2124
4,had lived there,1985,2482
4,than one had,1986,2168
4,that and in,1989,2381
4,Bertrand Russell was,1998,2327
4,people who wrote,2001,3306
4,It is what,2008,2342
4,Michelangelo would not,2026,3797
4,but I think,2026,3797
4,doubtless he would,2029,2179
4,is like a,2029,3570
4,like a painting,2029,2031
4,Van Gogh that,2032,2417
4,The Starry Night,2032,2417
4,Doubtless it has,2041,2761
4,summer when I,2041,2109
4,Or on the,2042,2526
4,on the first,2042,2894
4,as a painter,2050,2156
4,who went blind,2054,2642,3011
4,the one who,2057,3316
4,as many as,2059,2572
4,in which he,2059,2922
4,not to have,2059,2364,3530
4,could just as,2067,2804
4,just as well,2067,3365,3654
4,father was a,2071,2158
4,Andrea senza errori,2072,3410
4,he was also,2072,2975
4,mistake when he,2072,3376
4,during a plague,2074,2075
4,poor and neglected,2074,2196
4,as well If,2075,3184
4,more than ten,2076,3584
4,who had syphilis,2080,3010
4,during the Renaissance,2081,2343
4,was named after,2084,2086,2402
4,once lived in,2085,2621
4,Unless perhaps it,2086,3287,3423
4,number of seagulls,2091,2097
4,there were a,2097,3216
4,one sincerely doubts,2097,3146
4,my own cat,2099,2113
4,I remember this,2100,2935
4,a city cat,2100,3501
4,about that cat,2101,2261
4,a cat which,2103,3502
4,outside at night,2103,3502
4,that by then,2107,2893
4,might have to,2109,3605
4,such as a,2112,3606
4,Possibly there was,2116,2118
4,Emily Bronte once,2123,2929
4,simply because it,2123,2258
4,onto her bed,2123,2123
4,there are also,2124,2481,2547
4,Cat having been,2130,3490,3501
4,to the cat,2131,3526
4,name after all,2132,2808
4,Practically every single,2134,2135
4,good morning to,2134,2254
4,Good morning Rembrandt,2135,2254
4,I said it,2135,2511
4,not a color,2137,2138
4,apt to be,2140,2658
4,once climbed into,2143,2262
4,not long after,2145,2232
4,may have actually,2146,2956,3330
4,with the cat,2146,3501
4,How many people,2153,3614
4,something like this,2154,3208
4,if the pupil,2154,2174
4,to become famous,2155,2214
4,Why could n't,2156,2338,3386,3387
4,not necessarily always,2161,3041
4,to wonder just,2163,3307
4,have happened to,2163,3330
4,who was only,2166,3711
4,Bertrand Russell 's,2167,3062
4,Or even more,2169,2850
4,happy about this,2173,2467
4,that I knew,2177,2795,3415
4,no such thing,2177,2885
4,even if he,2179,2284,2408
4,that Van Gogh,2181,2426,2430,3436
4,the way he,2182,2396,2676,2776,3194
4,said that he,2183,2330
4,piece of tape,2186,2187
4,the piece of,2187,3349
4,painting in his,2190,2238
4,at the end,2193,2819
4,the work itself,2199,2200
4,in the very,2202,3531
4,a footnote I,2204,2482
4,realize is why,2205,2822
4,Certainly if I,2206,2723
4,to pick up,2206,3152
4,that one 's,2207,3531
4,to give a,2211,2683,2684

4,have done so,2236,2525,3481
4,had actually been,2237,3723
4,to go to,2240,2463
4,somebody who was,2240,2790
4,of Carel Fabritius,2242,3226
4,Carel Fabritius 's,2242,2333,3487
4,he had painted,2247,2697,3690
4,In the end,2250,3365
4,of those questions,2250,3327
4,shop or other,2252,2503
4,because it is,2258,2383,2539
4,Spinoza may have,2259,3203
4,may have preferred,2259,2497
4,remembering about that,2261,2970
4,that cat is,2261,3447
4,I believe there,2263,3742
4,having been a,2265,3451,3486,3501,3575
4,quite well of,2273,2274
4,a novel about,2274,3628
4,Then again if,2277,2988
4,him if he,2278,2280
4,the cat may,2282,2365
4,The more I,2283,2283,3016
4,each of those,2286,3563
4,though there were,2287,2711
4,Except when the,2289,2292
4,supposed to be,2293,2344,2991,3214,3360
4,not doing so,2295,2484
4,I am extraordinarily,2296,2717
4,pleased to have,2296,3415
4,have remembered that,2296,3072
4,the connection from,2298,2322
4,the entire question,2300,2589
4,Or should I,2302,2952
4,what I meant,2303,3141
4,was that nobody,2304,2823
4,in the plays,2304,3099
4,Except that if,2305,3764
4,if nobody ever,2305,3432
4,know that nobody,2305,2314
4,the seventh grade,2308,2389,3587
4,and the tortoise,2308,2312
4,catch the tortoise,2309,2389
4,And even though,2310,3377,3489
4,I know it,2314,2693
4,who had the,2316,2749
4,Archimedes was killed,2317,2319
4,he was writing,2319,3613
4,whom he was,2321,2321
4,pupil of Vermeer,2323,2323
4,that russet is,2329,2333
4,had been told,2330,2331
4,a color one,2333,3184
4,who painted the,2335,2381
4,it just as,2338,3226,3654
4,either of course,2339,2853,3038,3499
4,to imagine that,2340,2994,3649
4,across its front,2348,3752
4,of the circle,2351,2351
4,Carel Fabritius and,2352,3225,3226
4,I have seen,2355,3562
4,of those on,2355,2891
4,discover what the,2361,2596
4,Although in fact,2362,3177,3242
4,does not remember,2365,2492
4,as if to,2374,3439
4,have Carel Fabritius,2374,3225
4,any one of,2376,3346
4,after they had,2379,3048
4,has just come,2381,2808
4,At least it,2389,2800,3139
4,who could not,2389,3413
4,I now realize,2391,3407
4,the tortoise was,2391,2392
4,it was said,2395,2643
4,about is how,2397,2740
4,and used to,2397,2693
4,which I do,2404,2557,2802
4,were two more,2405,3282
4,painted versions of,2405,2405
4,what he did,2408,2757
4,the broken bottles,2413,2421,2423,2424,3436
4,that exists in,2414,2477
4,in it even,2418,3742
4,am seeing a,2420,2426
4,which the reproduction,2421,2429
4,in the Uffizi,2422,2423
4,a painting that,2426,3759
4,which to begin,2426,3514
4,out is that,2427,2815
4,a reflection of,2427,3449
4,is not only,2428,3115
4,but which is,2428,3406
4,Van Gogh painted,2430,3440
4,going to ask,2431,2432
4,he said that,2433,2683
4,And the way,2438,3032
4,in fact although,2438,2599
4,But what this,2439,2830
4,too as I,2446,3218
4,is perhaps the,2452,2515
4,At a guess,2459,3671
4,of the latter,2460,2504
4,wash fresh underpants,2463,2465
4,Naturally I did,2465,2543
4,until after I,2465,3623
4,Or perhaps I,2471,2608
4,believe I am,2475,3046
4,of such things,2476,3592
4,I wrote them,2479,3282
4,to put down,2481,2678,3592
4,lived in Toledo,2482,2487,2487
4,reason for not,2484,2487
4,as I said,2488,2635
4,about them in,2488,2587
4,in connection with,2488,2488,2493,2927,3403
4,writing what I,2489,2490
4,about Rembrandt and,2489,3386
4,may have also,2490,3182,3378
4,one may have,2492,2562
4,of the book,2495,2799
4,about Don Quixote,2495,3613
4,may have said,2496,2749
4,to each other,2496,3005
4,said in the,2496,3452
4,Well and doubtless,2502,3176,3588
4,would have happened,2503,3330
4,waiting on line,2507,3204
4,each of the,2507,2798
4,because of being,2508,3747
4,as opposed to,2508,3633
4,the same rule,2510,3412
4,a little while,2511,3783
4,said it was,2511,2749,2779
4,any woman artist,2514,2636
4,the one person,2515,2636
4,that many years,2518,3063
4,many years ago,2518,3257
4,say it would,2526,2654
4,in my shoulder,2527,2868,3456
4,that the pain,2532,2868
4,at least in,2538,3365
4,might have done,2540,2795
4,the basement Yesterday,2542,2563,2575,2848
4,Moving the lawnmower,2544,2550
4,one 's shoulder,2548,3439
4,of me to,2549,3078
4,moved the baseballs,2549,2592
4,the dampness in,2552,2554
4,dampness in fact,2552,3746
4,after all and,2554,3641
4,doubtless having been,2558,3227
4,having been what,2558,3371,3546
4,without having thought,2559,2635
4,rather than in,2565,2997
4,the additional books,2573,2574
4,odor of dampness,2582,2583
4,I had opened,2584,2594
4,this time however,2594,3311
4,occasion when I,2594,3764
4,other time I,2595,3303
4,With only one,2598,3366
4,By Gilbert Murray,2601,2604
4,able to read,2606,2608,2838
4,translation of The,2611,2827
4,in the title,2613,2772
4,the title and,2613,2786
4,that anybody would,2614,3044
4,I noticed that,2615,3477
4,that the book,2615,2784
4,book had been,2615,2708
4,Or that the,2617,2677,3457
4,in that language,2619,2623
4,in Mexico one,2622,3498
4,not read a,2623,2665
4,being what the,2627,2937
4,about Artemisia Gentileschi,2634,2640
4,being the one,2636,2943
4,Even if nobody,2637,3432
4,this in turn,2644,3360,3454
4,had been the,2644,2708
4,of the family,2647,3115
4,the framed snapshot,2649,3566
4,in the carton,2651,2711,2816,3380
4,to have given,2651,2686
4,it would certainly,2653,3602
4,I would still,2654,3625
4,the word Dasein,2655,2657
4,Martin Heidegger himself,2656,2658
4,knowing that he,2657,2754
4,Martin Heidegger 's,2658,3378,3389,3391
4,said I have,2659,2669
4,All things considered,2661,2802
4,fact it has,2662,2852
4,that every solitary,2662,2841
4,know about Brahms,2662,2673
4,I have furthermore,2669,3105
4,things I do,2673,3657
4,Such as about,2674,2940
4,that the first,2677,2859
4,any of such,2678,3592
4,put down that,2678,2679
4,Ludwig Wittgenstein was,2681,2682
4,later in fact,2683,3500
4,Although what one,2686,3054
4,that Wittgenstein had,2686,2747
4,some help with,2686,3279
4,Well or perhaps,2687,3520
4,to tell me,2689,3158
4,that Martin Heidegger,2693,3235,3240,3385,3391
4,used to put,2693,3440
4,been Martin Heidegger,2694,3367
4,with would have,2695,2926
4,there was only,2696,2771
4,a question of,2702,3285,3733
4,was also a,2706,2975
4,the title in,2707,2707,2772
4,than when one,2709,2760
4,mean that there,2712,3763
4,none of these,2713,3184
4,either of these,2717,2785
4,of these writers,2717,2729
4,familiar with them,2717,2718
4,farther than to,2719,2968
4,showing off again,2727,3310
4,any German writers,2728,2735
4,Quite possibly there,2731,2838,2840
4,having heard of,2734,3301
4,in the movie,2736,2801,2802
4,and Clara Schumann,2736,3420
4,Rainer Maria Rilke,2739,2758,3075,3078
4,not have a,2743,3325
4,Or even that,2748,2784,3651
4,At Galway Bay,2750,3408
4,to give it,2757,3442,3490
4,sound when one,2760,2762
4,when one is,2762,2808,3649
4,looking at them,2762,3783
4,my red roses,2764,2852
4,it had never,2765,3482
4,have recognized it,2773,3226
4,the photographs I,2774,2780
4,this as a,2774,2927
4,in some of,2775,2782
4,of the photographs,2775,2798
4,he was dressed,2775,2776
4,that the photographs,2780,2783
4,of the captions,2781,2797
4,that the person,2782,2804
4,the photographs was,2782,2798
4,the possibility that,2783,2925
4,the book itself,2784,2992
4,certain other names,2788,2789
4,appeared in English,2788,2789
4,the book in,2790,2799
4,and say to,2790,2793
4,but the names,2790,2793
4,an English name,2791,2808
4,that after having,2795,3127
4,would now appear,2800,3170
4,as I had,2800,2947
4,with in Arabia,2802,2805
4,that I mean,2803,2879
4,in Mexico for,2805,3499
4,was fighting with,2805,2805
4,after he had,2807,3690
4,he had gotten,2807,3064
4,what has also,2808,2930
4,in which what,2808,2988
4,a name like,2808,3304
4,I indicated that,2811,2855
4,worth pointing out,2812,2815
4,that a certain,2812,3258
4,to be saying,2812,2938
4,being the first,2813,2976
4,into a carton,2813,2817,2818
4,happens to have,2813,2889
4,the largest book,2813,2814,2814,2814,2817
4,into the carton,2814,2819
4,So what I,2815,3389
4,able to understand,2815,3519
4,about it either,2818,2928
4,Archimedes or Galileo,2818,2819
4,to do the,2819,3699
4,generally being a,2821,3249,3545
4,come to realize,2822,3374
4,Granting that this,2827,3386
4,cartons with books,2828,2829
4,have not even,2832,3158
4,on its side,2834,3746
4,as there are,2840,3533
4,back down there,2843,2845
4,down there at,2843,2987
4,not having put,2844,2853
4,gotten to be,2849,3775
4,put in is,2859,3137
4,the rain is,2865,2882
4,the whole notion,2867,2990
4,I am finally,2868,3392
4,to ignore it,2887,2889
4,So that by,2893,3796
4,as well Or,2894,3281,3365
4,of those occasions,2894,3290,3563
4,in the rain,2902,2968
4,might have felt,2905,3018
4,what one was,2909,3307
4,could very well,2914,3796
4,up as a,2914,3127
4,once he had,2917,3064
4,they move too,2920,3549
4,kept telling people,2920,3549
4,water in which,2922,2922
4,would have almost,2926,3114
4,have felt about,2928,3018
4,became famous for,2934,2934
4,thing I have,2934,3441
4,the real reason,2935,3065,3067
4,Even if something,2938,3652
4,because what I,2939,3623
4,turning out to,2940,3320
4,out to have,2940,3365
4,fact it may,2951,3355
4,now makes me,2973,3077
4,I undeniably am,2973,3572
4,one had gotten,2979,3304,3775
4,they have been,2980,3785
4,the identical thing,2982,3500
4,Here I sit,2984,3375
4,thing I had,2984,3223
4,to say about,2984,3617
4,about the basement,2984,2984
4,at all about,2984,3415
4,who wrote that,2985,3394
4,So that doubtless,2987,3078,3212
4,able to imagine,2987,3649
4,been struck by,2988,3334
4,possibly the book,2992,3380
4,Wittgenstein used to,2996,3443
4,used to play,2996,3661
4,reason he carried,2997,3442
4,So that anybody,2998,3157
4,A. E. Housman,3000,3000,3710
4,would not let,3001,3710
4,often used to,3005,3663
4,This being an,3010,3646
4,who was somebody,3012,3705
4,Michelangelo once wrote,3023,3025
4,being that I,3031,3270,3591
4,upset about that,3031,3419
4,the difference between,3032,3384,3469
4,that the Greeks,3049,3050
4,way in the,3050,3101
4,in the world,3050,3628
4,Helen would have,3054,3129,3156
4,if in The,3056,3540
4,had gotten the,3064,3105
4,idea to write,3064,3283
4,knew perfectly well,3067,3070
4,about the real,3067,3070
4,number of ships,3070,3079
4,I remember it,3071,3076
4,that doubtless it,3078,3187
4,one is only,3079,3649
4,there could have,3079,3762
4,being all that,3099,3647
4,suspected is that,3102,3105
4,whole story about,3102,3386
4,So that as,3105,3304,3620
4,Clytemnestra would have,3105,3111,3114,3117
4,How she would,3109,3637
4,surely being what,3111,3375
4,that very possibly,3112,3379
4,ten years in,3117,3121
4,remembering is that,3117,3416
4,Menelaus would have,3127,3166
4,a cat however,3134,3274,3414
4,having written that,3136,3143
4,about the dog,3138,3192
4,it being the,3138,3740
4,the dog who,3138,3141,3192
4,Odysseus when he,3138,3192
4,but then dies,3138,3192
4,who dies after,3141,3141
4,written that part,3143,3146
4,This again being,3151,3208
4,and even if,3156,3283,3396,3481,3516,3542,3756,3798
4,even if she,3156,3161
4,been the case,3159,3224
4,leave out certain,3161,3313
4,one solitary word,3165,3593,3739
4,And which would,3170,3390
4,that what one,3175,3640
4,so accustomed to,3176,3193
4,accustomed to a,3176,3304,3667
4,been about to,3177,3723
4,spoken about a,3182,3424
4,a cat of,3182,3531
4,by any means,3184,3302
4,the original Argus,3190,3191
4,having still been,3197,3511,3512
4,a cat that,3200,3448
4,to be about,3214,3616
4,When I finally,3215,3328,3592
4,walked into the,3215,3336
4,Even though my,3218,3241
4,people happened to,3224,3284
4,not to mention,3225,3698
4,just as quickly,3226,3615
4,Odysseus 's dog,3228,3587
4,fact the only,3229,3752
4,with Martin Heidegger,3231,3372
4,be that I,3233,3725
4,have obviously not,3234,3262
4,I had better,3237,3279
4,I am starting,3238,3243
4,I once wrote,3239,3485
4,Martin Heidegger a,3239,3392
4,my letter that,3240,3387
4,believe is that,3242,3785
4,What really happened,3244,3546
4,of famous people,3244,3298
4,Martin Heidegger was,3245,3379
4,it might even,3251,3627
4,more people than,3253,3617
4,the other people,3254,3292
