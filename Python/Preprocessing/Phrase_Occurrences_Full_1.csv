33,Was it really some other person I was so anxious to discover when I did all of that looking or was it only my own solitude that I could not abide ?,408,2121
30,Although doubtless when I say they are half empty I should really be saying they are half filled since presumably they were totally empty before somebody half filled them,810,2567
29,Still I find it extraordinary that young men died there in a war that long ago and then died in the same place three thousand years after that,28,894
27,Even if a part I have always liked is when Orestes finally comes back after so many years and Electra does not recognize her own brother,686,2953
27,Then again it is not impossible that they were once filled completely becoming half empty only when somebody removed half of the books to the basement,811,2568
25,so that I do not have to go and fight over Helen of Troy That hardly being the manner in which one imagines that,3045,3046
24,that one of the children to whom Brahms now and again gave some of that candy might very well have been Ludwig Wittgenstein,2679,2680
24,that young men died there in a war that long ago and then died in the same place three thousand years after that,3053
22,These beach houses are all wood of course All I could do was sit at the dunes and watch it burn,61,860
22,One moment I had been halfway up the stairs and a moment after that I was making believe I was Icarus,738,2873
22,Although doubtless I had been feeling out of sorts for some days which I would have invariably laid to other causes,752,2878
22,to see who would pay tariff to whom so as to be able to make use of a channel of water,892,3065
22,that Brahms was known for carrying candy in his pocket to give to children when he visited people who had children,2678,2682
21,Forgetting for the same instant that I was carrying forty-five square feet of canvas on stretchers up a stone stairway,749,2876
20,High high against the clouds little more than a speck but then swooping in the direction of the sea,378,3037
20,if I have concluded that there is nothing in the painting except shapes am I also concluding that there,845,877
20,can not remember what I had been trying to get that monstrosity of a canvas up that stairway for,984,2941
20,Should anybody else have looked where my signature would have been was under the other person 's image however,1026,2450
20,was known for carrying candy in his pocket to give to children when he visited people who had children,1946
19,able to see then is like that nine-foot canvas of mine with its opaque four white coats of,518,681
19,Skittering from one end of the main floor to the other in fact when the mood took me,759,2971
18,For the life of me I can not remember what I had been trying to get that,764,984,2045
18,Mornings when the leaves are dewy some of them are like jewels where the earliest sunlight glistens,328,2007
18,Before I ever saw one I would have supposed that castles in Spain was just a phrase,431,2120
18,I find this second possibility less likely than the first although it is not utterly beyond consideration,812,2569
18,Oh dear the wind has just broken one of the windows in one of the rooms downstairs,971,2862
17,I have no idea what I have been saying that has now made me think about,1556,2634,3426
17,small Like little more than your ordinary city block and a few stories in height practically,16,1984
17,that one can now kneel and drink from the Loire or the Po or the Mississippi,230,1191
17,You will never know how much it has meant to me that you are an artist,462,3590
17,What do you want strange man ? I believe this is what Electra says to him,687,2954
17,There is always something pleasurable about changing into garments that are still warm from the sun,1317,2466
17,even if I have no idea what I have been saying that has now made me,1556,2929
17,For some curious reason one 's meaning would generally appear to be understood in such cases,2806,3666
17,Now how could anybody be so foolish as to name a cat after a dog ?,3195,3209
16,reminds me of something even though I can not remember what it reminds me of,82,1285
16,I suspect that I may have neglected to run the battery for some time now,223,1185
16,I am quite certain so beautiful in the afternoon sun that had touched a chord,692,2958
16,Doubtless my ankle was only sprained Though it was swollen to twice its normal size,943,2046
16,the toilet on the second floor of the house that I burned to the ground,1239,1239
16,Like little more than your ordinary city block and a few stories in height practically,3052
15,When I say not speaking one word I mean not reading one either obviously,161,621
15,Well I knew a great deal about many painters for the same reason that,252,1932
15,And naturally all of this had occurred with what seemed no warning whatsoever either,751,2877
15,Well or in what looked like Greek although I was actually only inventing that,872,3043
14,that I remained in New York for at least two winters before I,195,3515
14,As many cans as there must have been Romans watching the Christians practically,364,2287
14,Brunelleschi returned home to Florence and put up the largest dome since antiquity,498,3688
14,it has been carried all of the way across the ocean by now,617,865
14,In spite of frequently underlining sentences in books that had not been assigned,626,1539
14,an explanation for why so many of the books in the house are,813,2570
14,And what have I been saying that has now made me think about,945,986
14,so that he can listen to the Sirens singing but will stay put,1284,2982
14,a history of music written for children and printed in extraordinarily large type,1800,1946
14,the question as to which life of Brahms it was that I read,1945,1959
14,been locked up in a loft in SoHo for all of its life,2103,3502
14,that nobody ever pays attention to a word Cassandra says in the opera,2304,2314
14,Which is to say that even though I happen to be thinking about,3262,3330
14,I have taken to building fires down near the water after my sunsets,3781,3782
13,nine-foot canvas of mine with its opaque four white coats of gesso,518,3678
13,Still how I nearly felt In the midst of all that looking,644,2948
13,back into the room with the atlas and the life of Brahms,661,841
13,a guide to the birds of Southern Connecticut and Long Island Sound,708,1687
13,The next morning it was swollen to twice its normal size nonetheless,737,2872
13,This would have been right after I had heard the glass naturally,972,2863
13,about inconsequential perplexities now and again becoming the fundamental mood of existence,1361,3393
13,I have not given that a thought for a week or more,2382,2383
13,when I brought up St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross,2487,2488
13,This is not really that complicated although it may seem to be,2491,3263
12,Well and I certainly would have found it agreeable to tell,1555,1734,3393
12,for a while that the Greek ships were beached there still,22,1981
12,a page torn out of an atlas instead of maritime charts,30,3090
12,For the life of me I have no idea why I,144,3722
12,are not the same museum even though they are both in,249,250
12,Directly above and to the side of where this typewriter is,464,3740
12,I am still feeling the typewriter naturally And hearing the keys,673,3027
12,convinced that I have never read a single word written by,799,1124
12,which is to say that the stick was already not lost,881,2900
12,for the life of me I can not remember having put,969,2115
12,seagull which came to his window each morning to be fed,1310,2747
12,a nice present but you do need a lot of time,1549,2683
12,about not letting a single person ever see him at work,1719,2058
12,Hm I would seem to have left something out just then,1851,3028
12,was born fifteen years before Rupert Brooke and was still alive,1998,2326
12,were aware that there had been a painter named Taddeo Gaddi,2275,2278
12,there is no painting by Van Gogh called The Broken Bottles,2423,2424
12,if my roses will still be red after it gets dark,2431,2432
12,When one says that one does not read one word of,2709,2709
12,Lawrence of Arabia did not look very much like Peter O'Toole,2775,2778
12,the day after the day after I went to the basement,2856,2857
12,the road to the house in the woods behind this house,3328,3328
12,Even if for the life of me I have no idea,3426,3722
12,think of my cat 's name in a day or two,3445,3453
12,how I nearly felt In the midst of all that looking,1684
12,so beautiful in the afternoon sun that had touched a chord,1685
12,guide to the birds of Southern Connecticut and Long Island Sound,3423
12,have no idea what I have been saying that has now,1970
12,was known for carrying candy in his pocket to give to,1944
11,What do any of us ever truly know however ?,734,1505,1601,3577
11,so that they would not make him go to fight,243,1269,1460
11,The Descent from the Cross by Rogier van der Weyden,1810,1835,3667
11,Well it would have been a harmless enough thing to,23,1983
11,even if there is not remarkably much left of it,64,1011
11,I am saying so only in a manner of speaking,126,3478
11,Such as the birthdays of people like Pablo Picasso or,129,1117
11,while I was peeing I thought about Lawrence of Arabia,264,2769
11,Any number of habits died hard that way For some,295,1241
11,Poor Electra To wish to murder one 's own mother,312,2963
11,I happen to believe the story about Giotto and the,509,2176
11,both printed on cheap paper and both ruined by dampness,532,664
11,or El Greco being the sort of thing that one,554,556
11,the opera that I am thinking about now I suspect,688,2955
11,In either event the present state of the shelves is,813,2570
11,right past St. Petersburg without knowing it was St. Petersburg,847,1680
11,what I was talking about when I was talking about,895,896
11,in one of the women 's rooms with a lipstick,1024,2448
11,What I was signing was an image of myself naturally,1025,2449
11,The slides that I took of my mother and father,1063,1065
11,naturally remains exactly where it had been all the while,1388,1389
11,there is no life of Brahms in the other house,1431,1471
11,head sometimes manages to jump about the way it does,1458,2646
11,they were not always aware of it was the way,1583,2182
11,I was one hundred percent positive that I was in,1694,1697
11,took away the tiny pocket sort of mirror from beside,1866,3560
11,would have found it agreeable to have been descended from,2178,2179
11,an occasion when Lucien brought William Gaddis to my loft,2262,2263
11,russet is not a name one gives to a color,2329,3180
11,Downstairs they go every last one of the troublesome things,2826,2839
11,the cat which scratches at the outside of my window,3400,3446
11,say when we put the cat out for the night,3496,3507
10,fill up with snow which must surely be rare,68,496,1136,1614
10,For the life of me I can not remember,920,969,974,2115
10,there would appear to be no record as to,3035,3196,3440
10,had himself lashed to the mast of a ship,79,2981
10,For the life of me I have no idea,604,3426
10,ten years for the war and still another ten,242,1278
10,For some reason a part I always liked was,243,1269
10,I once knew a great deal about many painters,251,1931
10,broken window in the room next to this one,327,950
10,behind my back since most of the cans had,366,927
10,mirror that had been beside my mother 's bed,546,1303
10,Surely it would have been easy to lose track,558,2152
10,ate his lunch every day at the Eiffel Tower,602,605
10,who is to argue that it might not have,618,1520
10,naturally I would have had no way of knowing,648,2119
10,never knowing just whom one might find as well,704,2950
10,Not until dusk did I emerge from the cul-de-sac,705,2959
10,or whoosh ! and here we go round the,760,2972
10,Many of the shelves up here are half empty,809,2566
10,There is nobody at the window in the painting,824,1421
10,I have very little idea what I mean by,836,882
10,at the window in the painting of this house,896,953
10,Though in fact the name I put down was,1028,2457
10,having taken up a board from the bathroom floor,1243,1244
10,The reverse of that statement being equally true obviously,1261,1664
10,Although very likely it was hardly that simple either,1325,1352
10,Sculpture is the art of taking away superfluous material,1330,2027
10,One has a fairly acute inkling as to when,1491,1570
10,I am by no means implying that there is,1499,1588
10,You do not need a lot of money to,1549,2683
10,Possibly I did not need to make that explanation,1874,2016
10,that the young woman is asleep in the Metropolitan,1876,1884
10,started to cry because somebody was hitting a horse,1896,3659
10,Although what I do only this instant realize is,2205,3421
10,that St. John of the Cross would have been,2505,3413
10,that I could have written this many pages without,2513,3321
10,look at the eight or nine cartons of books,2561,2576
10,reading the backs of the jackets on phonograph records,2662,2663
10,on when he went for walks in the woods,2693,3440
10,the back of the jacket on Thus Spake Zarathustra,2720,2722
10,the back of the jacket on The Alto Rhapsody,2721,2722
10,when one merely looks at it on the page,2760,2761
10,was dressed in the film about Lawrence of Arabia,2776,2782
10,sane and free from anxiety than by being mad,3024,3656
10,Even if there would appear to be no record,3035,3690
10,began to have thoughts along those lines as well,3280,3281
10,say when I found the cat waiting for breakfast,3495,3506
10,able to decide upon a name for a cat,3531,3531
10,Like little more than your ordinary city block and,259
10,Directly above and to the side of where this,1848
10,nobody ever pays attention to a word Cassandra says,2305
10,to the house in the woods behind this house,3751
9,the Hellespont By which I mean the Dardanelles,29,1585,3715
9,To the castle a sign must have said,549,1467,3802
9,there is nobody at the window in the,587,824,1421
9,the house that I burned to the ground,1012,1012,1249
9,I suspect there is something ironical in my,1065,1124,3487
9,The world is everything that is the case,1215,1221,1227
9,St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross,2482,2489,2502
9,from which I watch the sun go down,133,1365
9,have been what put me in mind of,149,150
9,must surely have known a great deal about,252,1932
9,it was a woman who wrote the Odyssey,293,1841
9,I was about to add that this was,298,1463
9,Wrist deep in it the lot of them,313,2964
9,was able to maneuver directly up the hillside,390,3510
9,There are no painting materials in this house,463,576
9,the other house farther down the beach which,528,656
9,he did not have to look at it,603,605
9,I do not believe I have ever mentioned,630,1367
9,in any of the plays about anybody menstruating,725,1489
9,the way in which I was standing naturally,748,2875
9,convinced that there is somebody at the window,831,833
9,As a matter of fact I have now,842,2357
9,gold coins on the floor of his studio,889,3186
9,coins on the floor of Rembrandt 's studio,952,2335
9,of the rooms here that I do not,998,3744
9,Or soon I will be coming to the,1012,1239
9,about anxiety being the fundamental mood of existence,1122,2694
9,a street called Maiden Lane near Covent Garden,1136,2065
9,toilet fastened to pipes on the second floor,1237,2968
9,what I am now thinking about is the,1284,2323
9,would hide under a table when there was,1343,2057
9,Although when one comes right down to it,1490,1954
9,but was thinking there is my house ?,1536,3326
9,One of the things people generally admired about,1583,2182
9,As a matter of fact I have no,1648,2577
9,in the vehicle which went over the embankment,1648,1649
9,asleep at a table in the Metropolitan Museum,1815,1817
9,be hearing a different piece of music entirely,1872,1873
9,that when one comes right down to it,2030,3069
9,Even if for the life of me I,2115,2941
9,the cat that scratches at my broken window,2184,2359
9,the Piero who did not hide under tables,2197,2299
9,I was extremely sorry to hear about your,2255,2255
9,the cat I saw in the Colosseum and,2286,3400
9,Willem de Kooning was not descended from anybody,2301,2303
9,a painting of a fire which is not,2428,3449
9,something I did not remember I remembered until,2489,2490
9,to look at the eight or nine cartons,2561,2575
9,the backs of the jackets on phonograph records,2673,2719
9,I could not make sense out of the,2712,2781
9,my including the back of the jacket on,2722,2722
9,the first book to have been put into,2812,2813
9,Now heavens how weary I have gotten of,2824,2825
9,Even if what this next reminds me of,2831,2934
9,if the carton had not had a label,2987,2988
9,returns to Ithaca after having been gone for,3138,3192
9,I might have thought about writing to then,3262,3330
9,having been contrived in a spirit of fun,3271,3299
9,ask me what my almost cat 's name,3284,3294
9,instances lately when I have spoken about my,3331,3424
9,felt In the midst of all that looking,360

8,As a matter of fact it was,21,384,3062,3670
8,Although as a matter of fact I,1179,2493,2577,2891
8,the road one takes to the town,1373,1375,1376,1753

8,As a matter of fact I believe,286,2220,2493

8,One 's language is frequently imprecise in,81,1253
8,in a manner of speaking of course,126,566

8,What I was doing was trying to,448,1637
8,English license plates and a right-hand drive,496,3221
8,with such industry that people believed they,497,3687
8,seem to decide on a name for,515,2129
8,write a strange calligraphy against the whiteness,517,2044
8,to see if the breeze might make,521,3765

8,As a matter of fact I did,529,2003
8,when one stops to think about it,557,2146
8,I believed I saw somebody at a,593,631
8,I have no idea how I know,604,2693
8,Any more than I have any idea,604,2930

8,that Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz,1444,2621
8,continually looking in and out of windows,1502,2122
8,Which is also to say that it,1529,3459
8,to worry me to tell the truth,1537,3034
8,Although come to think about it I,1543,3528
8,even if I have no idea what,3444,3755
8,I enjoy knowing both of those things,1564,2753
8,was wrong about a woman having written,1574,3136
8,from under one arm to the other,1676,1913
8,sent shivers up and down my spine,1715,3215
8,him not to spend so much time,1721,1723
8,although I know of no record of,1724,1899
8,they were called the Four Last Songs,1785,1786
8,To tell the truth I do not,1804,3581
8,fact it is not even impossible that,1948,2841
8,of Brahms having had an affair with,1965,1969
8,Homer did not know how to write,1974,3080
8,a harmless enough thing to make believe,1983,3786
8,fifty years after Brooke had died on,1998,2326
8,my condition of feeling quite guilty continued,2105,2106
8,the cat I saw at the Colosseum,2111,2112
8,climbed into Willem de Kooning 's lap,2142,2143
8,had a pupil of his own named,2226,2324
8,been thinking about a good many things,2454,2455
8,the fact that El Greco may have,2489,2490
8,I did not move any of the,2545,2548
8,the eight or nine cartons of books,2564,2565
8,about Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz,2656,3404
8,the back of the jacket on a,2665,2955
8,by saying that I am familiar with,2717,2718
8,not stop on such occasions as when,2790,2793
8,that the life of Lawrence of Arabia,2811,2922
8,of having a house full of books,2838,2838
8,if I have not made that clear,3008,3332
8,that there is no better way of,3024,3656
8,grass that is not real is real,3032,3032
8,one thousand one hundred and eighty-six ships,3048,3050
8,But be all that as it may,3082,3252
8,this whole thing still one more time,3242,3243
8,been considered more famous than Martin Heidegger,3246,3247
8,in the eyes of people who admired,3249,3250
8,And as a matter of fact I,3253,3328
8,now and again whether I have mentioned,3322,3340
8,that every single time I have mentioned,3343,3344
8,what I ought to have mentioned was,3343,3344
8,on his way to becoming a stranger,3519,3521
8,one can be as alone as when,3648,3649
8,explanation for not having written anything in,3723,3726
8,For the life of me I have,3750
8,I do not believe I have ever,335
8,In the midst of all that looking,1177
8,lunch every day at the Eiffel Tower,1350
8,the atlas and the life of Brahms,1001
8,at the window in the painting of,824
8,on the second floor of the house,1237
8,when he visited people who had children,1944
8,there would appear to be no record,2242
8,in the film about Lawrence of Arabia,2777
7,As a matter of fact I,52,140,543,660,1179,1415,1668,1695,1854,2102,2843,2891,3253
7,Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz,187,1118,2619,2620,2628,2629,2733,3403,3713
7,now that I think about it,371,769,1206,1254,1333,1415,1666,2818
7,There would appear to be no,770,1484,2242,3035,3196,3440,3690
7,As a matter of fact it,827,1143,2262,2662,2951,3627
7,But be that as it may,29,1157,1884,2166,3156,3503
7,As a matter of fact the,400,436,892,1635,2453,3229
7,As a matter of fact what,452,980,2420,3105,3115,3726
7,And to tell the truth I,1086,1547,2553,2609,2962,3264
7,In a manner of speaking one,142,843,1054,2014,3593
7,When one comes down to it,459,1086,1258,2828,3191
7,For the life of me I,988,1372,2642,2941
7,As a matter of fact there,561,786,1654,2481
7,Though as a matter of fact,645,660,1334,2481
7,As a matter of fact even,909,1688,1903,3186
7,Which is to say that I,951,1243,1360,3684
7,Although as a matter of fact,1654,2420,2951,3505
7,a life of Lawrence of Arabia,2771,2773,2773,2784
7,I do not believe I have,1747,1804,1838
7,In a manner of speaking I,411,3346,3572
7,about wandering through an endless nothingness,413,798,1624
7,I am next to positive that,975,2264,3228
7,to tell the truth I had,982,1770,3264
7,Which is to say that it,1036,1683,3321
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned having,1244,2541,3021
7,I believe I would have liked,1554,1733,2756
7,of The Way of All Flesh,1603,1840,2611
7,Do n't bother to get up,1735,2063,2914
7,The young woman is asleep in,1818,1876,1884
7,This is scarcely to suggest that,2335,2339,2770
7,I have no idea how long,5,1059
7,took me only two unhurried days,30,3090
7,I was mad when I drove,36,153
7,I burned to the ground I,60,1012
7,well come to think about it,65,1855
7,with a right-hand drive and watching,68,1614
7,which came rolling down a hill,69,1133
7,I am quite certain that I,75,427
7,hundreds and hundreds of tennis balls,87,3638
7,watchfires being lighted along the shore,94,1982
7,to do that sort of thing,101,3291
7,as long ago as when I,102,1114
7,for instance which I am convinced,129,1117
7,from all of those years ago,130,1354
7,no more than three or four,131,321
7,I have no idea why I,544,1847
7,I am less than positive that,147,3729
7,It did run on that madness,151,2967
7,does not have to be mad,152,3516
7,keeping a weather eye out for,158,1293
7,not speaking one word of Russian,160,2475
7,say that I was looking for,170,171
7,startled me and how I felt,192,1135
7,is here it will be here,213,1115
7,I no longer have any idea,225,3287
7,idea who she may have been,225,1118
7,To tell the truth I would,226,1114
7,All I can remember about the,253,1967
7,that Helen was the cause of,256,890
7,Helen has a splendid radiant dignity,262,1277
7,a pee and Lawrence of Arabia,266,2770
7,I may or may not have,272,3756
7,I have no idea any longer,282,2820
7,To tell the truth it was,304,495
7,the central staircase in the Metropolitan,304,735
7,making use of all sorts of,308,3511
7,I did not think about it,311,1219
7,was an effective Helen in The,315,1447
7,that I watched a certain few,316,1452
7,I have a vague recollection that,321,1427
7,I am fairly certain that I,331,1925
7,if that is at all relevant,331,1330
7,To tell the truth I did,354,1547
7,no way of telling if the,366,1428
7,which brought me to this beach,377,384
7,when I thought I saw the,379,380
7,I thought I saw the cat,379,379
7,The cat at the Colosseum was,402,513
7,I thought about them like that,410,411
7,Generally even then I was lonely,416,3801
7,that the castle was built on,429,429
7,on the inside of the roof,445,1645
7,the rubber mat from the floor,445,1637
7,I have no recollection whatsoever of,457,3757
7,A painting of this very house,465,3741
7,'s name that caught my eye,495,1121
7,built the beautiful campanile next door,500,3689
7,it is not impossible that people,507,640
7,Andrea del Sarto or Taddeo Gaddi,507,888
7,down to the water 's edge,517,3677
7,been printed on extraordinarily cheap paper,523,3768
7,As a matter of fact one,1237,2587
7,which I burned to the ground,528,1009
7,under the influence of William Shakespeare,538,1569
7,positive of a life after death,540,2636
7,that it was a life of,544,2773
7,there would have had to be,577,1144
7,the taverns from which one could,600,600
7,one allows one 's self to,610,948
7,being sold in the shops for,628,883
7,I saw somebody at a window,631,641
7,a shop selling artists ' supplies,642,2947
7,All of the books in the,647,2582
7,had been under the influence of,649,1569
7,the painting is on the wall,660,662
7,the life of Brahms that I,663,1434
7,One might as well ask if,671,1423
7,what exactly was I hearing ?,677,839
7,and in any manner one wished,683,3679
7,from where all arts and all,693,1740
7,may not have been broken but,736,2871
7,I believe I have mentioned having,757,2777
7,stairway for on the other hand,764,2941
7,the Four Serious Songs by Brahms,771,1791
7,in the basement of this house,786,3380
7,eight or nine cartons of books,788,2822
7,cartons of books in the basement,788,2578
7,at the rear of the house,791,2557
7,if I have not indicated that,792,1164
7,yesterday or the day before yesterday,798,802
7,did not make any sort of,803,2985
7,the books in the basement are,808,822
7,Baseball When the Grass Was Real,814,1472
7,I am in no way certain,853,2778
7,night that my rowboat disappeared as,862,1249
7,Somebody is living on this beach,874,3803
7,even if I can not remember,888,1273
7,without so much as a glance,900,3186
7,in the sand With a stick,909,2317
7,had no way of knowing if,927,2119
7,I started to type that sentence,947,2281
7,fact I am next to positive,975,3026
7,in no way connected to the,977,1613
7,The tape deck in the van,978,1631
7,Though to tell the truth I,982,1114
7,book about art in this house,995,2836
7,There is the house that I,1012,1233
7,is the sort of thing that,1037,3760
7,a painting of a Passover meal,1056,1075
7,one of them was in a,1068,2598
7,I decided to take a walk,1071,1416
7,to tell the truth I have,1086,2560
7,I came back from the town,1098,1099
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned that,2142,2680
7,There is an explanation for the,1129,2393
7,I read the life of Brahms,1131,1132
7,it is quite possible that I,1147,2539
7,make a major project out of,1199,1381
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned how,1200,1643
7,now and again I will be,1201,1809
7,the house that I am dismantling,1207,1230
7,no more than one of semantics,1212,3735
7,become the fundamental mood of existence,1226,2744
7,I knocked over the kerosene lamp,1237,2968
7,I find it interesting that I,1258,1288
7,my laundry which is spread across,1301,3795
7,for a certain period near water,1310,1312
7,to be a road leading to,1371,1379
7,I was not able to locate,1372,1380
7,is a thing one might do,1403,1405
7,see this house from that one,1406,1415
7,that I have more than once,1439,2479
7,there is an explanation for my,1482,3030
7,explanation for my generally speaking of,1482,1625
7,the two dots over Bronte however,1484,1626
7,what with the considerable likelihood that,1501,1976
7,never even once had a lover,1501,1976
7,Although come to think about it,2915,3149
7,about The Way of All Flesh,1578,1843
7,of Achilles hiding among the women,1581,2405
7,I have only at this instant,1610,3334
7,listen to Maria Callas singing Medea,1630,1670
7,Which is to say that perhaps,1640,3074
7,had nothing to do with that,1688,3241
7,a pharmacy or a movie theater,1690,1695
7,numeral on the back of the,1691,3778
7,I have no way of telling,1744,2363
7,Perhaps I have not mentioned the,1752,2523
7,the Four Last Songs by Strauss,1783,3419
7,number of times in these pages,1794,1795
7,I had not been thinking about,1813,1822
7,all I had started to say,1822,2426
7,painting by Rogier van der Weyden,1824,1885
7,I am able to state categorically,1832,2475
7,have no idea why I have,1847,2642
7,Oh All I had meant to,1852,3029
7,that I was not able to,1883,2711
7,When Friedrich Nietzsche was mad he,1896,3659
7,soccer shirt with the name Savona,1905,3752
7,wish to pursue such a question,1905,1906
7,What I find interesting about this,1911,2708
7,I have in mind is that,1937,2472
7,a wreath at Achilles 's grave,1991,1995
7,I have not mentioned having been,1999,2541
7,meantime I would appear to have,2002,2126
7,it is not one hundred percent,2030,2319
7,If one squints just a little,2031,2417
7,did not care very much for,2050,2051
7,all it actually means is that,2071,2492
7,seagulls at the garbage disposal area,2091,3407
7,Once when I was painting in,2099,3500
7,I was feeling quite guilty about,2102,2107
7,to let the cat back in,2107,2134
7,argue that he might not have,2150,2336
7,to suggest that Willem de Kooning,2215,2339
7,Willem de Kooning could have been,2215,3596
7,would not have been able to,2222,2708
7,On the other hand it is,2251,3066
7,climbed into William Gaddis 's lap,2262,2282
7,One is made to think about,2266,2266
7,wrote a novel called The Recognitions,2273,3075
7,an alarm clock around his neck,2274,3075
7,would not have been aware of,2276,3210
7,when he himself was a pupil,2330,2331
7,it was Willem de Kooning who,2335,3181
7,come to think about it since,2378,3044
7,the painting of this very house,2381,3740
7,and to which the door is,2383,3744
7,fire but is only a reflection,2428,3449
7,one did not remember one remembered,2481,2492
7,the pain in my left shoulder,2522,2523
7,I was downstairs in the basement,2540,2542
7,to go down to the basement,2559,2575
7,So that to tell the truth,2560,3245
7,why I went down there yesterday,2560,2847
7,books in the one carton I,2584,2842
7,book from the carton that I,2606,2771
7,of the books from the carton,2610,2704
7,book called The Way of All,2616,2616
7,called The Way of All Meat,2616,2825
7,that as a matter of fact,2623,3105
7,by Marco Antonio Montes de Oca,2624,2651
7,when one says it out loud,2625,2760
7,I would have been thinking about,2633,3262
7,By which I mean that if,2684,3292
7,that I was able to recognize,2706,2771
7,just as many books about art,2838,2840
7,least as I started to say,2880,3578
7,must have had more important things,2994,2995
7,once underlined a sentence by Michelangelo,3021,3022
7,I am next to positive I,3026,3339
7,that Electra and Orestes would have,3098,3101
7,she would have immediately understood that,3108,3109
7,when I say house I should,3110,3128
7,Which is to say that doubtless,3165,3187
7,I have just been talking about,3191,3350
7,I can no longer be certain,3256,3257
7,it may have been William Gaddis,3287,3355
7,I have thought about Magritte practically,3323,3341
7,lost track of where I was,3352,3353
7,I should really be saying wrote,3370,3610
7,and there is the cat which,3400,3401
7,Which is not to say that,3411,3456
7,doing was lying in the sun,3458,3580
7,one 's husband had become drunk,3544,3544
7,that one can just as easily,3650,3651
7,there is practically no place in,3692,3693
7,from which one can not see,3692,3693
7,if there had not been any,3764,3765
7,a few stories in height practically,259
7,I was about to add that,22
7,himself lashed to the mast of,1284
7,a part I always liked was,3770
7,I thought about Lawrence of Arabia,2771
7,when one comes down to that,313
7,come to think about it I,438
7,above and to the side of,565
7,a strange calligraphy against the whiteness,3676
7,one stops to think about it,3378
7,out of sorts for some days,717
7,that I have never read a,1843
7,an explanation for why so many,1502
7,without knowing it was St. Petersburg,848
7,which is to say that the,3774
7,gold coins on the floor of,2335
7,on the floor of his studio,895
7,so as to be able to,1308
7,in the painting of this house,954
7,the floor of Rembrandt 's studio,2131
7,I have not mentioned that I,3738
7,I have no idea what I,1216
7,fastened to pipes on the second,3685
7,the tiny pocket sort of mirror,1303
7,taped to the living room wall,1526
7,The title of the life of,1433
7,looking in and out of windows,3552
7,how fond I am of his,1734
7,even if I have no idea,3003
7,history of music written for children,1961
7,the cat which scratches at the,2114
7,and St. John of the Cross,2631
7,the life of Lawrence of Arabia,2819
7,one thousand one hundred and eighty-six,3070
7,And as a matter of fact,3691
7,Which is to say that even,3648
7,that every single time I have,3342
7,to decide upon a name for,3503
6,As a matter of fact,164,205,220,493,505,634,645,817,848,867,1109,1334,1507,1623,1720,1731,1956,2033,2052,2160,2168,2172,2226,2233,2278,2328,2373,2623,2718,2743,2771,2814,2914,2965,3010,3147,3233,3505,3653,3691,3767
6,which is to say that,951,1036,1093,1243,1360,1519,1561,1640,1683,1974,2840,3074,3080,3119,3127,3146,3165,3187,3262,3321,3330,3379,3406,3564,3608,3648,3684
6,come to think about it,630,821,956,1268,1292,1724,1994,2260,2337,2402,2612,2762,2844,3154

6,To tell the truth I,483,657,982,1086,1302,1770,1980,2553,2560,2609,2962,3264
6,Marco Antonio Montes de Oca,187,1310,1444,2626,2733,3286,3287,3294

6,Even if I have no,457,1556,1744,2929,3003,3444,3755
6,when one comes down to,459,1086,1258,2828,3191
6,possibly I have not mentioned,1079,2585,2663,2747,2870
6,was one more person who,1975,2642,2736,3010,3713

6,There is an explanation for,76,1075,1482,3030
6,I have no idea why,292,1213,1295,3003
6,and a moment after that,193,859,1134,1175
6,I was not able to,227,443,574,1633

6,set to the on position,774,1615,1784,2671
6,I have more than once,808,1544,2230,3102
6,would appear to have been,823,1476,2460,3139
6,Now and again I have,870,1085,1618,2038
6,I have no idea what,1151,1538,1605,2474
6,in the history of art,1336,1337,2913,2921
6,had been a pupil of,2151,2280,2299,2299
6,Every single time I have,2939,3342,3343,3344
6,I suspect I may have,9,370,3255

6,I do not have any,162,968,2354
6,that I am speaking about,181,377,2746
6,Through all of that time,194,1532,3379
6,I would have had to,236,1649,1813
6,Have I mentioned looking in,387,1294,3039
6,that I am talking about,434,2870,3740
6,a painting of this house,468,530,655
6,for all that I was,514,1381,1622
6,was a life of Brahms,523,544,1434
6,For that matter I have,569,1440,2634
6,As far as to the,617,866,2005
6,who is to argue that,2150,2236,2333
6,I believe I have mentioned,1133,2546,3052
6,In either event it was,773,2728,2897
6,'s name by the way,785,1286,3188
6,it remains a fact that,834,958,3272
6,there is no way of,838,925,1428
6,any number of times in,911,1794,3682
6,the life of Brahms was,988,1132,1309
6,what I am more truthfully,1104,3153,3785
6,I am convinced that I,1117,1124,3515
6,almost hit by the car,1132,1133,1134
6,on the other hand I,1146,1287,2340
6,in this case it is,1243,1923,2414
6,Although what I am now,1284,2275,2673
6,Doubtless it would have been,1308,1976,3176
6,either to tell the truth,1393,1920,2942
6,Then again it is perhaps,1422,1942,2606
6,has anything to do with,1471,2138,3457
6,upside down in the Mediterranean,1632,1641,1660
6,with the name Savona on,1656,1690,1905
6,that I would have been,1659,2558,2606
6,when I was thinking about,1814,1823,2488
6,What I mean is that,1873,2654,3032
6,equidistant from each other too,2000,2288,2291
6,to the garbage disposal area,2005,2013,3401

6,Although on the other hand,2246,2778,3066
6,Which is to say the,2417,2631,3788
6,reminds me of is that,2439,2692,2934
6,I believe I have said,2658,2822,3464
6,it to tell the truth,2693,2882,2990
6,Although what I am really,2740,2970,3085
6,may very well have been,2745,2894,2951
6,photographs of Lawrence of Arabia,2773,2779,2783
6,had anything to do with,3456,3472,3474

6,I have no idea how,2192,2583
6,when I was doing that,5,3486

6,of one 's only child,40,3516
6,There is only one mirror,43,1029

6,when it was that I,46,190
6,when I was at the,49,1119
6,fire I had at the,51,83
6,still prone to think of,64,1011
6,my old loft in SoHo,66,2965
6,I have lost track of,67,1924
6,hill with nobody driving it,70,3651
6,And in either case I,73,1096

6,I am quite certain I,85,1287

6,the Spanish Steps in Rome,87,355
6,of the ancient Greek plays,140,527
6,manner of speaking one might,142,143

6,that those last two sentences,147,2884
6,when I went to Mexico,152,172
6,the grave of one 's,152,3516
6,not speaking one word of,620,3234

6,I am not certain whether,179,2374
6,that Rogier van der Weyden,182,2177
6,I am almost certain that,195,559
6,of my path to the,214,1192
6,I rarely make use of,218,787
6,The houses along this beach,221,1008
6,I would like to inform,230,1191
6,the last four digits of,234,1354

6,Would n't she have ?,242,3085
6,Achilles dressing like a girl,243,292
6,remain in one 's head,248,2580
6,I harbor sincere doubts that,255,1556
6,A single Spartan girl as,257,3055
6,when I read the plays,263,542
6,Meanwhile I have just been,264,2768
6,I can think of no,266,735
6,of Lawrence of Arabia at,269,2773

6,is one more of those,270,2250

6,I have not indicated that,316,802
6,appeared to be the case,345,3251
6,divested myself of the watches,347,1257
6,getting rid of the watches,356,356
6,When I say that I,357,524
6,I had no way of,366,927
6,I do not mean only,381,1561
6,may as well stop looking,386,3641
6,the seat of this chair,406,674
6,since the last time I,422,3139
6,The explanation being that the,429,3190
6,Perhaps there is no connection,439,506
6,all of this time I,444,3744
6,fallen on top of me,445,1637
6,I have just said it,451,2779
6,None of this is counting,475,2670
6,in the window of a,494,2947
6,Well the point being that,502,603
6,a life of Brahms which,523,1796
6,read the life of Brahms,526,1168
6,is a painting of this,530,3741
6,Unless of course there were,532,2097
6,of Brahms in this house,532,3769
6,One does not name a,537,2186
6,occurred to me that the,541,2389
6,the fact that I was,542,1895
6,at the time when I,542,2488
6,Conversely I have no idea,544,2192
6,even if it happens that,552,1511
6,who is to say that,558,1954
6,fairly abstract at that point,563,3743
6,in my head as well,567,2382
6,of my own such as,572,834
6,changes anything in the painting,572,834
6,the door to the deck,573,574
6,that perhaps she had been,585,1640
6,at the dunes the painter,588,675
6,a street full of taverns,597,2946
6,place in Paris from which,603,3693
6,also happen to know that,604,2074
6,not wish to look at,605,3694
6,frequently imprecise in such ways,606,1253
6,Sometimes I like to believe,617,865
6,One would certainly wish to,622,2994
6,I did well in college,626,1539
6,in any of these pages,630,1288
6,somebody at a window in,631,1421
6,one is apt to visualize,634,635
6,I would have had no,1263,2691
6,that the painting is not,655,2427
6,certain that the painting is,660,1273
6,And at least we have,663,1945
6,set fire to the pages,663,1845
6,on those forty-five square feet,685,2951
6,And here of all places,691,2957
6,It was only the Parthenon,692,1685
6,no less from where all,693,2960
6,Still for a time I,694,1686
6,which was actually a cul-de-sac,699,2946
6,against a small stretched canvas,706,2947
6,To tell the truth one,707,779
6,a Volkswagen van filled with,709,1630
6,There is naturally nothing in,725,1489
6,I had been doing was,739,3580
6,a wind which caused that,742,2874
6,broken windows in the museum,742,2874
6,And I do not even,746,1443
6,a tape deck in the,769,977
6,the Four Last Songs by,772,1785
6,that came into my head,798,1822
6,I should really be saying,3110,3538
6,I have put that badly,832,2306
6,to say was that I,833,3723
6,what I mean by that,836,1438
6,could have driven right past,848,1680
6,have been able to tell,849,2689
6,actually I do not remember,854,1014
6,I do not remember that,854,884
6,the cause of that war,890,3054
6,during the first World War,893,1585
6,no matter how many times,902,1380
6,One finds it difficult to,905,1867
6,it difficult to think of,905,1977
6,writing in the sand With,909,3643
6,which is the one thing,912,2123
6,the end of his life,926,2193
6,agreeable to think of Brahms,935,1965
6,one has no idea how,940,2092
6,one of the popes made,942,2520
6,By which I mean that,947,2712
6,I began to think about,949,950
6,to be a book about,956,957
6,a book about baseball is,956,1803
6,one is not thinking about,964,964
6,I had been thinking about,967,1303
6,positive that I have never,975,1843
6,on the afternoon when I,976,2946
6,that the life of Brahms,988,1852
6,is that I would have,990,2558
6,I have now remembered that,1003,1930
6,occurs to me is that,1005,2749
6,to think of it as,1011,3278
6,to the house that I,1012,1195
6,In fact I have no,1018,2479
6,the Borghese Gallery in Rome,1023,1662
6,one mirror in this house,1029,3562
6,to say that it is,1036,1529
6,I did not believe I,1044,2533
6,I would have wished to,1044,1845
6,that The Last Supper was,1054,1056
6,the table beside my bed,1068,2649
6,is a painting of a,1075,3449
6,in either case I have,1089,2466
6,since one would have surely,1091,2148
6,to make certain that the,1097,1409
6,why I did not remember,1100,1102
6,Doubtless this is only because,1101,3399
6,more of the sound of,1101,3425
6,at least did not come,1119,3704
6,an hour ago when I,1119,1357
6,in some way connected to,1126,2796
6,too tall for the shelves,1130,2834
6,And in either event I,1131,1709
6,on the morning when I,1132,1262
6,the life of Brahms and,1134,1522
6,it crashed into something else,1142,1144
6,it on the other hand,1146,1199
6,To this day I have,1151,3219
6,on a morning when I,1151,1682
6,when I happened to be,1151,3764
6,happened to be visiting in,1151,1620
6,I did not see the,1158,1814
6,if I had wished to,1160,2595
6,a life of Brahms in,1169,3769
6,not a life of Brahms,1170,1522
6,printed in extraordinarily large type,1172,1223
6,I am dismantling a house,1196,1197
6,turning dismantled lumber into firewood,1210,3733
6,After it has been dismantled,1211,3734
6,not too long ago all,1218,1805
6,to myself a hundred times,1220,2688
6,what I have been saying,1221,2161
6,In the meantime I have,1223,3334
6,of a life of Brahms,1223,1845
6,a second copy of the,1225,1435
6,copy of the identical book,1225,1473
6,Even if there is no,1238,2969
6,I now remember that I,1240,1452
6,I have not mentioned having,2585,3739
6,I will not trouble to,1253,3799
6,What happened was that I,1255,3239
6,The reverse of that statement,2617,3145
6,have had no reason to,1263,1753
6,the scene in which Odysseus,1284,2982
6,For some reason this story,1285,3444
6,from the life of Brahms,1309,2386
6,while I was out there,1317,2892
6,and then one day I,1324,1351
6,moment in the history of,1336,2921
6,not to be confused with,1344,2057
6,by the way which was,1344,3188
6,that I had not been,1359,1822
6,when I first came to,1370,2668
6,there has got to be,1379,2816
6,road leading to that house,1379,1382
6,in the pickup truck as,1383,2005
6,and of change of life,1396,2702
6,I imagine I can understand,1401,1401
6,Although what I was more,1404,1823
6,the person who had translated,1411,2602
6,What happened was that there,1416,3284
6,I would appear to have,1421,2460
6,walked to the other house,1423,1424
6,On the other hand there,1428,2652
6,in the other house is,1433,1610
6,forced to wonder is if,1436,2673
6,the life of Brahms would,1436,1523
6,when I have not seen,1440,1441
6,I do not even know,1443,2381
6,But what I am actually,1445,2836
6,what I am actually now,1445,2261
6,Well which is to say,1449,3608
6,What I would more seriously,1458,2088
6,one of the women pregnant,1465,2326
6,anything to do with the,1471,3474
6,Baseball When the Grass Is,1476,1477
6,would have been more appropriate,1477,1523
6,on the other hand is,1478,2490
6,even if I have forgotten,1513,3420
6,all the way down to,1520,3677
6,if I have not said,1521,3756
6,to be a life of,1525,2771
6,wall in the other house,1526,1535
6,A certain amount of this,1537,3034
6,never read one word of,1543,1544
6,On my honor Wittgenstein once,1550,3001
6,for a name when one,1567,2070
6,I would have sworn I,1575,1824
6,The Way of All Flesh,1577,2616
6,is always touching everybody else,1583,2408
6,Which in either case still,1591,3092
6,is one of the saddest,1597,3427
6,nothing to do with the,1608,2461
6,I have no explanation for,1625,3726
6,of the two dots over,1626,1626
6,how wet I had gotten,1642,1643
6,one more thing that I,1645,2009
6,answers the question as to,1677,1841
6,wished to stop at Corinth,1681,1688
6,that I had already been,1681,3682
6,the Tate Gallery in London,1698,3215
6,which finally led me to,1711,2575
6,Euripides was said to have,1720,2438
6,The reason I have not,1753,2383
6,rolled down the Spanish Steps,1758,1759
6,in spite of having been,1768,3091
6,finds it agreeable to be,1776,2830
6,Life of Brahms or The,1796,3750
6,The Life of Brahms or,1796,3750
6,Even if I had not,1813,2630
6,certainly I would have had,1813,2691
6,that painting by Jan Vermeer,1815,1875
6,Rogier van der Weyden and,1824,1933
6,about Rogier van der Weyden,1832,2177
6,than positive that I have,1843,3729
6,doubtless I would have scarcely,1844,2987
6,The life of Brahms is,1848,1852
6,I had meant to say,1852,2984
6,is now in my head,1875,2382
6,Although what I am more,1876,2894
6,asleep in the Metropolitan Museum,1876,1879
6,now struck me is that,1879,2808
6,it is a fact that,1884,2682
6,be willing to wager that,1905,3618
6,I did not put in,1928,2852
6,there would have been no,1961,3050
6,this is only because I,1999,3399
6,I have never mentioned before,2009,3339
6,a painting by Van Gogh,2030,2031
6,nine-foot canvas up the main,2045,2870
6,at the garbage disposal area,2048,2413
6,But which in either case,2091,3092
6,New York for a summer,2099,3500
6,as well even though I,2102,2382
6,Even if as I have,2124,3180
6,my russet cat 's name,2126,2132
6,a name for the cat,2128,3493
6,one automatically associates with Rembrandt,2136,3184
6,has something to do with,2138,2468
6,when Willem de Kooning was,2144,2328
6,on the other hand which,2150,3322
6,all the way back to,2153,2742

6,become equally as famous as,2168,2174
6,seem to have anxiety in,2182,2695
6,had to live off charity,2193,2194
6,in the case of Rembrandt,2214,2355
6,would have been less than,2238,3127
6,there was no connection between,2244,2801
6,surely would have at least,2251,3150
6,All of this would have,2257,2503
6,would have been said in,2257,2496
6,for no other reason than,2271,3184
6,may not have climbed into,2282,2365
6,remained equidistant from each other,2284,2288
6,something that does not exist,2293,2293
6,that Willem de Kooning was,2303,2339
6,could certainly catch that tortoise,2311,3587
6,I had meant to write,2321,3029
6,up my mind to imagine,2340,2346
6,a soccer shirt With the,2348,3752
6,I have just decided to,2369,3446
6,even though I have not,2382,2414
6,was said to have died,2392,2438
6,On my honor it was,2395,2750
6,only because of having mentioned,2409,2438
6,exists in my head even,2414,2415
6,a certain amount of the,2419,2865
6,a reproduction of the painting,2420,2424
6,which is not a real,2428,2428
6,being only in my head,2429,2508
6,to the spring again to,2463,3794
6,something to do with the,2468,2632
6,existed only in my head,2475,2526
6,I have no doubt that,2479,2694
6,I did not put it,2483,2650
6,in Toledo when El Greco,2485,2487
6,what I am talking about,2486,3583
6,one doubts that either of,2504,2785
6,Even if I am perhaps,2528,2727
6,Although I do believe I,2564,2624
6,believe I have mentioned the,2564,3052
6,more than once perplexed me,2565,2822
6,Even if I did not,2576,2848
6,which had been translated from,2600,2713
6,but had been written in,2619,2713
6,familiar with the names of,2622,2704
6,have only been because of,2624,3466
6,Juana Ines of the Cross,2629,2631
6,had something to do with,2632,2703
6,it is no more than,2632,2733
6,as I believe I have,2658,3052
6,have been a life of,2660,2784
6,been a life of Brahms,2660,3769
6,Kathleen Ferrier singing Vincenzo Bellini,2672,2672
6,thought it may have been,2699,2923
6,the names of the writers,2704,2712
6,the carton that I was,2711,2771
6,other book from the carton,2771,2811
6,every single word in the,2786,2787
6,Even if on second thought,2787,3329
6,I am reading is in,2790,2793
6,Lawrence of Arabia would not,2807,2819
6,that it was also the,2811,2812
6,as it happens is that,2812,2830
6,to be thought of as,2830,3115
6,agreeable to be able to,2830,3350
6,lately to tell the truth,2832,3725
6,I have been thinking about,2834,3122
6,being too tall for the,2834,3747
6,it what with not having,2844,3739
6,At any rate it is,2879,3791
6,that there would have been,2902,3050
6,Have I ever said that,2981,3221
6,grass that is not real,2986,3031
6,incidentally if I have not,3008,3756
6,to begin with of course,3054,3708
6,but decided that in a,3067,3070
6,would be a more interesting,3067,3070
6,it is equally possible that,3069,3203
6,only twenty or thirty ships,3072,3073
6,forced to suspect is that,3079,3175
6,lived happily together ever after,3104,3115
6,be saying palace of course,3110,3128
6,likely it would have been,3160,3504
6,fairly certain I have mentioned,3178,3179
6,pharmacist would have put it,3200,3201
6,had just gotten a cat,3267,3269
6,And even if it was,3283,3542
6,even if it was not,3283,3675
6,visited at my studio himself,3288,3289
6,Certainly I have thought about,3322,3585
6,one of the Bachianas Brasileiras,3337,3343
6,the Bachianas Brasileiras by Villa-Lobos,3337,3339
6,permitted to have a cat,3404,3417
6,not have had a cat,3406,3411
6,after the rain had stopped,3434,3580
6,is not really a cat,3448,3772
6,anything to do with my,3456,3457
6,why I was feeling depressed,3476,3485
6,village not far from Oaxaca,3497,3508
6,I would sometimes say when,3506,3507
6,a good deal of both,3545,3545
6,that I did not intend,3591,3607
6,very little else to write,3602,3608
6,And which is to say,3617,3684
6,to keep out of my,3625,3652
6,Well and poor all the,3715,3719
6,past seven or eight weeks,3723,3726
6,how could I have once,3764,3765
6,it is far too chilly,3791,3792
6,it would have been a,2874
6,three thousand years after that,3715
6,be that as it may,3312
6,By which I mean the,893
6,with a right-hand drive and,1136
6,I am quite certain that,1273
6,reminds me of something even,3444
6,by Rogier van der Weyden,85
6,as long ago as when,1541
6,all of those years ago,2644
6,from which I watch the,561
6,I am less than positive,2467
6,Juana Ines de la Cruz,225
6,can now kneel and drink,3012
6,has a splendid radiant dignity,3057
6,may or may not have,2365
6,To tell the truth it,2849
6,I do not believe I,3528
6,in one of the rooms,349
6,since most of the cans,2119
6,I was so anxious to,514
6,tiny pocket sort of mirror,461
6,beside my mother 's bed,461
6,of my mother and father,484
6,it is not impossible that,913
6,if I have not indicated,513
6,strange calligraphy against the whiteness,1192
6,printed on extraordinarily cheap paper,530
6,I do not have to,534
6,at the window in the,536
6,Surely it would have been,1947
6,is to say that it,558
6,would have had to be,963
6,being sold in the shops,629
6,attention to a word Cassandra,637
6,and the life of Brahms,3751
6,that I am thinking about,1809
6,that monstrosity of a canvas,739
6,the basement of this house,2551
6,of the house that I,794
6,the books in the basement,2582
6,that there is somebody at,1421
6,idea what I mean by,1216
6,the painting of this house,1848
6,that one wishes she had,2124
6,having had an affair with,935
6,I am next to positive,1313
6,tape deck in the van,977
6,in no way connected to,2537
6,to which the doors are,3750
6,I have not mentioned the,1079
6,And to tell the truth,2273
6,I have not mentioned that,2747
6,it was that I read,1131
6,everything that is the case,2688
6,when I have spoken about,1235
6,I am now thinking about,1459
6,of the life of Brahms,1435
6,thinking there is my house,1775
6,have found it agreeable to,3502
6,not read one word of,1578
6,had nothing to do with,1608
6,to Maria Callas singing Medea,1704
6,I have no way of,2653
6,The young woman is asleep,1877
6,I had started to say,2984
6,What I find interesting about,2925
6,a pupil of his own,2174
6,what I do only this,2822
6,that I do not have,2354
6,St. John of the Cross,2484
6,that I could have written,2635
6,the eight or nine cartons,2577
6,The Way of All Meat,2614
6,when he went for walks,3441
6,I was able to recognize,2811
6,make sense out of the,2708
6,jacket on The Alto Rhapsody,2723
6,I have thought about Magritte,3322
6,what I ought to have,3726
6,cat out for the night,3498
6,decide upon a name for,3528
5,on the other hand,276,555,795,905,1085,1116,1242,1337,1428,1495,1621,1867,2077,2183,2251,2403,2456,2627,2652,2656,2714,2724,2741,2808,2820,2902,2922,3035,3142,3174,3411,3440,3545,3565,3690,3777,3798
5,To tell the truth,4,225,747,865,873,882,1050,1265,1393,1537,1920,2173,2273,2375,2412,2467,2589,2693,2832,2882,2942,2990,3034,3082,3245,3301,3463,3725,3771,3794
5,I do not remember,106,190,233,446,525,619,1121,1303,1678,2109,2403,2557,2922,3061,3450,3489
5,as I have said,87,94,1324,1374,1383,2020,2424,2461,3394
5,would appear to be,1080,1125,1231,1626,2371,2722,2916,2938,3031
5,that I did not,321,1085,1161,1678,1910,2479,2606,2728
5,What I had been,739,764,984,1106,1303,2045,2939,2941
5,In fact I have,871,1296,1356,1544,2300,3323,3341,3462
5,In fact it is,1207,1910,1948,2887,3154,3335,3780,3792
5,Although when I say,2803,3110,3256,3370,3478,3538,3610,3665
5,in the National Gallery,1,73,244,246,1883,2268,2343
5,Even if I have,107,1513,2559,3282,3420,3562,3724
5,what happened was that,452,1255,1416,1598,1755,3239,3284
5,In fact it was,514,1046,1693,2215,2316,2344,2549
5,This would have been,1022,1621,1981,2257,2447,2643,3408
5,even if I had,1091,1813,1881,2595,2630,3396,3470
5,it may have been,1790,1936,2694,3181,3345,3394,3545
5,I do not believe,511,893,1314,1678,2765,3526
5,a life of Brahms,530,1436,1439,1439,2661,3745
5,was one of the,728,2577,2682,3196,3343,3380
5,Even if I am,799,2467,2868,2978,3515,3756
5,which is to say,2417,2526,2631,3531,3628,3788
5,Doubtless I would have,1420,1568,1844,2274,2730,2987
5,the name of the,354,619,1287,3225,3446
5,it would have been,756,2526,2595,3064,3209
5,What I did was,29,112,352,486,1669
5,may well have been,35,78,645,997,1522
5,a good deal of,67,1125,2052,2755,3513
5,The explanation being that,76,1076,1483,2394,3031
5,I had wished to,85,766,1688,2596,3223
5,as far as to,86,617,866,1092,2005
5,Even if it is,100,817,2791,3772,3789
5,in one 's head,123,128,1116,2412,2477
5,I would not have,766,988,1206,3072,3234
5,by the time I,467,947,1321,2729,3258
5,a certain amount of,488,806,1537,2612,3034
5,at the same time,565,2482,2812,3107,3489
5,on second thought I,584,1108,2432,3329,3450
5,At the intersection of,641,689,1307,2946,3328
5,that I might have,879,2974,3233,3431,3751
5,In fact I am,975,1000,1273,3247,3727
5,by the way I,1873,3214,3331,3424,3686
5,when I was in,2,412,493,2308
5,in the Metropolitan Museum,2,485,1818,2045
5,when I was still,2,322,1164,3543
5,for a certain period,7,8,1805,3493
5,But in either case,11,580,3381,3612
5,in one of the,19,484,1592,3107
5,Although doubtless I have,67,858,3288,3738
5,it was not the,80,663,718,2234
5,Well as I have,94,2581,2669,3611
5,in the opposite direction,99,867,1193,1289
5,Not too long ago,125,1218,1805,2167
5,as it turned out,180,758,2866,3296
5,I have said that,207,245,682,3464
5,would have had to,1007,1145,2081,3111
5,in The Trojan Women,315,317,1445,3056
5,right at this moment,327,1811,2076,3727
5,that I had not,331,441,766,1255
5,I am positive that,356,358,1014,3247
5,I suspect I have,426,2306,2605,2620
5,Now and again I,519,608,1201,1809
5,the life of Brahms,544,1796,1848,3750
5,of The Trojan Women,543,1447,2600,2827
5,Such things can happen,602,1218,1807,2861
5,did not wish to,605,668,1974,3588
5,to do was to,743,1048,1409,1757
5,I believe I have,965,1305,1973,3147
5,in the pickup truck,769,1208,2076,3682
5,to be connected to,853,1609,1902,1902
5,in the sand with,870,909,2317,3643
5,In addition to which,889,1642,2237,2421
5,the manner in which,985,2988,3195,3200
5,me is that I,990,2513,2749,2938
5,a certain number of,1021,1154,1509,3258
5,that one would have,1093,1609,2906,2908
5,is that I am,1102,2420,2426,3082
5,Even if one would,1116,1519,3469,3777
5,I was thinking about,1120,1824,2181,2699
5,in heaven 's name,1138,2644,3085,3658
5,for quite some time,1140,2525,2553,3681
5,that I have not,1288,1925,2665,2833
5,is not my trade,1335,1714,2315,3654
5,for the longest time,1372,2105,2510,3415
5,There is my house,1418,1536,1775,3326
5,turned out to be,1656,2062,2171,3573
5,is that I have,1753,2815,3089,3340
5,the young woman is,1817,1818,1877,1879
5,I was trying to,1997,2319,2404,3766
5,And in the meantime,2002,3016,3305,3446
5,Willem de Kooning is,2149,2347,2356,2362
5,this sort of thing,2173,2916,3034,3068
5,a pair of boots,2182,2693,2695,2696
5,Even if one is,2267,2445,2658,3050
5,Or for that matter,2299,2675,3309,3639
5,only in my head,2378,2413,2472,3789
5,exist on these pages,2472,2473,2474,2475
5,would have been the,2695,3054,3109,3224
5,When one says that,2789,2804,2805,2812
5,having been able to,3328,3460,3487,3595
5,And even if I,3396,3481,3756,3798
5,living in the Louvre,1,1259,1262
5,I do not know,8,1119,2484
5,Time out of mind,9,1067,3558
5,to look at the,12,466,3694
5,And at any rate,14,3184,3791
5,at any rate I,14,1213,1593
5,I do not mean,14,228,418
5,by way of the,29,1099,1099
5,Such as for instance,32,845,2032
5,a day or two,32,2469,3094
5,here in this house,43,57,114
5,say that It has,44,843,3459
5,So that the smoke,52,54,2943
5,one can see the,59,76,2968
5,when I looked back,60,880,2899
5,walk along the beach,62,805,1220
5,even if there is,1238,1846,2969
5,And in either case,168,3470,3736
5,I am quite certain,1760,1852,2548
5,I can not remember,277,2660,3134
5,perhaps I did not,94,1219,2471
5,In the beginning I,103,104,322
5,on the morning after,110,1598,3676
5,in my rearview mirror,113,1291,3525
5,I am talking about,457,977,3722
5,Les Troyens by Berlioz,125,980,1823
5,all of those years,2683,3574,3784
5,where I am sitting,131,401,2076
5,Even if I did,154,3313,3374
5,in either case the,168,440,961
5,One moment I was,193,859,1134
5,I ought to have,199,420,1360
5,I have taken to,212,956,1206
5,at the gas station,224,820,855
5,I would like to,2536,3012,3771
5,doubtless there was no,233,374,376
5,I have never been,235,1645,2815
5,on my own part,239,1351,2215
5,so many of them,242,1989,2572
5,is that there is,253,1879,3177
5,But what I am,258,3117,3153
5,I doubt that I,268,324,1280
5,of Lawrence of Arabia,1453,2780,2798
5,I believe it was,286,2855,3361
5,I did that In,286,354,1024
5,At one of the,302,359,3222
5,that I would have,324,1480,1556
5,When I say they,346,810,2567
5,I saw the cat,356,359,512
5,the sound of the,385,951,1146
5,I had no idea,389,1702,3470
5,Every last one of,405,2826,2839
5,I have also just,407,567,2511
5,when I was not,409,1258,1439
5,Or perhaps it was,441,1935,2944
5,A painting of this,468,530,655
5,it was not a,466,1176,3675
5,I rarely did portraits,483,1042,1398
5,the Via Vittorio Veneto,494,1121,1663
5,that it was a,502,1841,2274
5,Yet it is not,507,557,2030
5,it is not impossible,1789,2188,2188
5,fires along the beach,519,2038,2040
5,in the other house,528,1525,1527
5,in such a way,530,2222,3584
5,two lives of Brahms,532,664,823
5,Once when I was,538,1966,2308
5,the fact that I,1231,1678,1803
5,may not have been,543,2783,2784
5,house to the ground,543,1250,3642
5,life of Brahms I,544,661,1522
5,that El Greco was,552,557,925
5,I had not noticed,562,1162,1631
5,just closed my eyes,567,573,3029
5,of the house in,580,1237,2558
5,in regard to the,591,763,2243
5,with all of those,619,2417,3700
5,there would have been,639,1173,2572
5,not being able to,653,3472,3531
5,this could have been,669,2154,2732
5,Though perhaps it was,685,696,1312
5,even before I had,710,2900,3620
5,for me to have,712,2735,3762
5,the way in which,2834,3111,3224
5,that there was a,777,1225,1416
5,It is not one,787,2030,2319
5,that one does not,791,940,1604
5,thinking about a cat,951,962,3211
5,except insofar as the,951,952,956
5,next to positive that,1495,1691,3050
5,The Seasons by Vivaldi,978,1805,1823
5,which I did not,985,1547,2852
5,In this instance I,987,2381,3076
5,is that I would,1578,2654,3652
5,may have only been,997,2493,2624
5,only one of the,1001,1339,3366
5,For some reason the,1055,1274,1880
5,I have not been,1070,2833,3750
5,If it was not,1123,3283,3675
5,Kierkegaard or Martin Heidegger,1124,1474,1540
5,as I have perhaps,1125,1680,2124
5,Certainly it would have,1145,2159,3064
5,surely I would have,1160,1263,1845
5,all of this having,1164,3271,3497
5,I would have been,1174,3019,3020
5,For some reason I,1217,1672,2296
5,I have just made,1229,2348,2648
5,In either case doubtless,1262,1613,3612
5,into one of the,1271,2943,3744
5,Although what I am,2261,2385,3416
5,I did leave out,1287,3313,3543
5,Although I am perhaps,1315,1486,1916
5,I was able to,1321,1533,3678
5,Hugo van der Goes,1343,1344,1621
5,at all when I,1370,3214,3540
5,to locate the road,1372,1378,1382
5,I am going to,1382,1787,2431
5,In fact what I,1386,3102,3242
5,on an afternoon when,1416,2141,2144
5,of this sort of,1419,1504,3034
5,The life of Beethoven,1432,1433,1472
5,not happen to be,1436,2836,3324
5,a copy of The,1440,1473,1511
5,As I have indicated,1473,2591,3065
5,by the way ?,1498,2911,3667
5,for instance when I,1509,2134,2482
5,And for that matter,1510,2917,3699
5,as well even if,1519,2179,2797
5,that I have no,1577,3723,3726
5,that there is any,1588,1689,2770
5,any number of people,1606,2273,3609
5,so as not to,1623,2059,3199
5,the question as to,1872,2847,3094
5,is in no way,1678,1953,2888
5,that at the time,1688,1865,3044
5,In any event I,1747,1919,2264
5,The tennis balls I,1758,1774,1778
5,come into my head,1809,2381,3386
5,in my head is,1875,2416,2424
5,a fact that the,1884,3169,3272
5,in any case it,1894,2138,2765
5,have appeared to be,1902,3251,3725
5,In fact I would,1905,3019,3352
5,in which case I,1910,1997,3259
5,painting by Van Gogh,2416,2417,3449
5,a garbage disposal area,2035,2109,3436
5,was somebody else who,2054,2749,3705
5,Although doubtless it is,2077,2693,2701
5,and the cat which,2114,2129,2291
5,that I have now,2132,2974,3684
5,than Willem de Kooning,2141,2325,3596
5,have been descended from,2150,2156,2215
5,as I have also,2229,2551,2659
5,in Giotto 's studio,2346,2360,2366
5,if I were to,2385,2510,3621
5,a good number of,2404,3188,3256
5,I was writing about,2468,2482,2526
5,that even when one,2492,3648,3649
5,would have only been,2525,3183,3466
5,moving the rusted lawnmower,2540,2543,2590
5,to the basement yesterday,2563,2575,2848
5,every single one of,2598,3252,3265
5,is that if the,2708,3032,3417
5,say that I am,2714,2778,3024
5,have been just as,2732,3365,3407
5,may very well be,2780,3186,3725
5,which would have been,2819,2992,3401
5,one of these people,2824,3252,3284
5,by walking in it,2883,2886,3475
5,one of the people,2926,3196,3366
5,the two of them,3102,3119,3204
5,I wrote letters to,3244,3252,3253
5,for that matter poor,3699,3702,3720
5,the messages would say,1,874
5,would say when I,2,3495
5,it was when I,5,286
5,I was doing that,145,1638
5,to visit at the,11,37
5,I have forgotten the,13,2145
5,to be called the,14,2825
5,Even in late spring,18,2451
5,had been Helen 's,20,3059
5,near the end of,20,926
5,about when I was,21,3486
5,would have been a,1478,2992
5,I had planned to,24,111
5,In any case on,25,1057
5,where Achilles was buried,26,27
5,I did was pick,29,1169
5,of the Greek islands,29,197
5,All of this being,35,566
5,the name of one,40,814
5,house on this beach,43,1230
5,that It has come,44,2133
5,on the backs of,44,2673
5,almost forgotten about it,45,494
5,I am certain that,46,1000
5,it was that I,2073,2102
5,at the Metropolitan Museum,49,484
5,I did that with,54,143
5,from one of the,54,306
5,one of the balconies,54,305
5,second house on this,60,1230
5,burned to the ground,1230,1231
5,though perhaps I had,60,1646
5,I walked to the,60,1424
5,think about it The,65,2283
5,in an automobile with,68,496
5,once that same winter,69,2448
5,being almost hit by,69,1133
5,almost hit by a,69,3651
5,had a right-hand drive,72,1137
5,was living in the,73,1259
5,Where I lived in,74,184
5,Joseph Mallord William Turner,74,2933
5,I lived at the,75,102
5,that one can see,76,2417
5,own paintings of water,78,1699
5,well have been a,78,2745
5,the top of the,87,756
5,of the Spanish Steps,87,388
5,except that I had,87,2487
5,Volkswagen van full of,87,976
5,one after the other,87,3638
5,each one of them,88,3638
5,Well perhaps it was,93,3532
5,could still see the,94,113
5,I did not really,94,1377
5,Meanwhile I have just,97,1455
5,I do not go,97,998
5,not go to the,97,583
5,as well Such as,104,2809
5,morning after I had,110,1683
5,when I began to,121,1106
5,I got rid of,122,136
5,that I believed I,127,357
5,I believed I had,127,2898
5,In fact there is,133,829
5,fact there is a,133,786
5,perhaps indicate that there,138,2129
5,Especially when I was,139,3218
5,when I was mad,139,1258
5,understood why I was,145,3476
5,that doubtless I would,145,2987
5,that I read the,148,1131
5,when I drove the,153,976
5,not remember if I,159,2557
5,I drove right past,160,847
5,while I am typing,163,564
5,if I happen to,167,2651
5,also say that I,171,2778
5,for what earthly reason,176,1460
5,to all of those,3485,3600
5,I lived in Madrid,178,184
5,shed most of my,181,1114
5,they had named after,184,3040
5,on my way from,191,1057
5,spinnaker taking noisy wind,191,3091
5,that there was the,193,3276
5,Would it have been,195,330
5,ought to have said,199,2815
5,wear nothing at all,209,1319
5,Well I have more,211,2230
5,all the way to,214,1666
5,and there is a,216,1073
5,make use of my,218,3477
5,by the way In,221,2975
5,still be able to,221,1240
5,that I may have,1427,2749
5,the National Portrait Gallery,249,269
5,is not one of,227,787
5,not one of the,227,2221
5,was not able to,1343,2838
5,that many of the,227,2604
5,have already been dead,231,3258
5,as if I were,231,1911
5,all over again ?,231,2318
5,never been to the,235,1085
5,There is a painting,244,2452
5,is a painting of,244,656
5,painting of Penelope weaving,244,414
5,by somebody named Pintoricchio,244,3177
5,that is on the,246,3325
5,on the island of,246,1586
5,'s head after all,248,3652
5,I should also perhaps,249,2129
5,perhaps point out that,249,2803
5,for the same reason,1658,2429
5,the painting of Penelope,253,414
5,a ball of yarn,253,2112
5,Still it is perhaps,254,2640
5,if I have been,254,3571
5,A single Spartan girl,891,2404
5,could not have been,263,1172
5,and dropping them into,263,3072
5,them into the fire,263,1308
5,than I do about,265,1843
5,that I remember The,268,2470
5,in my head But,270,1535
5,Although it was not,281,1331
5,In fact I also,283,2754
5,when I went back,286,876
5,set fire to the,288,858
5,Across the wide Mississippi,289,3525
5,for instance in his,291,2032
5,Agamemnon had sacrificed their,291,3086
5,for the Greek ships,291,1334
5,For that matter it,293,1703
5,For some years I,295,782
5,taking the trouble to,296,3366
5,side of the road,296,1772
5,Hector ran and ran,297,2391
5,that this was the,298,603
5,that may have been,300,351
5,may have been one,300,1453
5,Heaven only knows why,301,3415
5,on one of the,305,523
5,so that it would,307,2595
5,the lot of them,2214,2742
5,at my loft in,322,2144
5,sound of the sea,326,385
5,I am fairly certain,2127,3178
5,certain that I had,331,3744
5,wore an alarm clock,334,2274
5,I would say it,335,2459
5,that I do not,335,1678
5,ever read The Recognitions,335,3076
5,I am more likely,336,2894
5,In a town called,347,1694
5,in the car and,350,352
5,some time before I,355,1231
5,the cat which was,356,2131
5,When I say that,2778,2780
5,I mean that I,357,947
5,I believed I saw,357,359
5,As quickly as I,362,1386
5,that would have been,362,3109
5,full to begin with,366,927
5,may have been a,371,3545
5,the cat Calpurnia after,375,899
5,this beach that I,377,1230
5,little more than a,563,2590
5,I was not mad,380,409
5,set fire to them,381,531
5,intending to ask for,388,3638
5,I went to the,390,1301
5,on top of which,394,2429
5,I was forced to,395,1175
5,would be able to,401,1019
5,be able to see,401,1408
5,it is already tomorrow,418,419
5,to fill up with,421,440
5,and then I went,421,3508
5,Yesterday 's sunset was,422,806
5,the last time I,920,976
5,being aware of it,423,2277
5,called Savona which is,433,1630
5,Part of the embankment,434,1248
5,I did not feel,441,471
5,what kind of a,446,2518
5,that I have just,451,1904
5,I had climbed back,453,979
5,I had been driving,455,1141
5,is that I was,456,2511
5,of ever having driven,457,1648
5,was a painting of,468,1056
5,I did not go,469,2848
5,there could well be,476,2702
5,It is agreeable to,479,3153
5,able to find the,481,3328
5,all of my paintings,485,491
5,for so many years,489,3192
5,One of those I,493,814
5,Early in the Renaissance,497,3687
5,next door to that,500,707
5,that same tiny mirror,504,3588
5,like Leonardo da Vinci,507,2905
5,I also believe I,510,802
5,believe one word of,511,1280
5,Andrea del Sarto and,511,3718
5,remember any longer if,512,2922
5,all that I was,1148,1805
5,all we ever called,516,2130
5,when the snows come,517,1192
5,hidden and the beach,517,3677
5,I tore the pages,521,531
5,Most of the pages,522,3767
5,right next to me,522,3767
5,say that I sometimes,524,1243
5,But I do believe,526,2145
5,book in this house,526,1473
5,in this house which,526,2836
5,in this house is,528,1013
5,to remind myself where,528,993
5,when I decided to,529,1416
5,very much like this,530,965
5,behind where the painting,530,544
5,to simulate a seagull,531,1224
5,singing The Alto Rhapsody,533,677
5,perplexed as to how,539,2528
5,for the fact that,542,3273
5,only now realize that,543,1834
5,realize that I may,543,1038
5,I may not have,543,2811
5,that other house to,543,657
5,in the process of,543,881
5,into the fire after,543,2446
5,out on the beach,544,663
5,without being reminded of,551,552
5,so many years But,558,3192
5,But who is to,558,1520
5,go back even farther,558,2337
5,even farther than that,558,2299
5,does appear to be,560,795
5,If it is a,563,2682
5,is fairly abstract at,563,1104
5,window while I am,564,593
5,and on the wall,565,567
5,Although I have also,567,1513
5,do the same thing,568,3699
5,For that matter I,1058,1681
5,I have only now,569,965
5,I happen to have,571,2651
5,in the painting itself,575,580
5,begin to trouble me,575,2794
5,Unquestionably there would have,577,1173
5,with the exception of,578,2881
5,inside of the house,580,581
5,house in the painting,580,954
5,one can not see,580,1406
5,Then again very likely,582,1690
5,one is forced to,583,2445
5,go to the beach,583,1097
5,I have decided that,584,1474
5,I will try to,588,2759
5,Even if I will,589,3798
5,in this house either,589,1005
5,to do is to,590,3446
5,and while I was,594,2864
5,while I was still,594,1304
5,I was still looking,594,1164
5,even though they were,600,2182
5,Unless of course the,601,2239
5,in the case of,602,2238
5,he did not have,1737,2156
5,that Guy de Maupassant,604,605
5,of my own as,607,3182
5,Doubtless I had not,613,1326
5,if it is still,615,3789
5,not have gotten to,618,3170
5,remember the name of,619,3472
5,in either case not,620,3381
5,it was somebody named,625,883
5,that one could even,627,1982
5,of course So that,636,2982
5,Then again it is,2380,3203
5,after so many years,640,2152
5,a window in a,642,1421
5,saw my own reflection,645,706
5,the one that I,646,1648
5,to let myself into,646,2759
5,when one types it,650,1567
5,if I had not,651,1174
5,would have been difficult,652,2595
5,I have now made,655,2346
5,of the other house,656,1370
5,I can not call,657,1831
5,that house and this,658,1408
5,Houses along a beach,659,1214
5,fact I can not,660,2660
5,entered my mind to,661,1038
5,that it was not,663,1176
5,Unless as I have,664,3394
5,as I have suggested,664,2276
5,Well and the other,667,1870
5,the person in the,667,2782
5,been at the window,670,833
5,Yesterday when I was,677,840
5,when I was hearing,677,839
5,The Alto Rhapsody what,677,3343
5,almost as if one,683,3679
5,I had intended to,685,2951
5,to begin with on,685,2902
5,somebody called my name,689,721
5,It was only the,2118,2958
5,almost wished to weep,694,1686
5,into the book on,714,1844
5,for what it might,714,1687
5,in spite of my,717,1000
5,been out of sorts,717,1359
5,doubtless it was not,718,1639
5,had been coming on,720,3681
5,in any of the,2797,3360
5,that there had been,729,750
5,remind me of the,735,2982
5,that one has no,740,940
5,one has no way,740,2799
5,Until such time as,741,2838
5,it was a wind,742,743
5,being what I thought,746,1418
5,in which I was,1375,2489
5,to close my thighs,748,2875
5,all of this had,3116,3645
5,however I believe I,757,2475
5,at maneuvering my wheelchair,758,2970
5,I had not done,766,2594
5,Kirsten Flagstad was singing,778,1783
5,so as to have,779,2686
5,tape deck was playing,779,983
5,Or at least to,780,2795
5,made it necessary to,780,1048
5,When I was living,783,1259
5,There is no longer,785,1238
5,by the way Even,785,2775
5,in the basement also,788,793
5,in addition to the,788,1472
5,the remainder of the,790,2786
5,that in the painting,791,1885
5,baseballs in the basement,793,804
5,There is also a,794,1472
5,been mowed at the,796,958
5,written by Friedrich Nietzsche,798,799
5,that I have never,2009,2815
5,are continually looking in,800,1502
5,I stopped at the,804,1168
5,at the point where,804,3354
5,I came to the,804,2793
5,I went for a,805,2005
5,the other house which,805,1366
5,an explanation for why,3010,3186
5,would appear to have,2529,3774
5,If it is not,826,3772
5,it is not a,826,1175
5,somebody who had been,833,2151
5,In either case it,834,2365
5,ago when I was,839,1119
5,the painting back into,841,1881
5,the day after tomorrow,843,2849
5,Willem de Kooning and,852,2364
5,I suspect it is,853,2188
5,my loft in SoHo,854,2144
5,Although what I really,856,3794
5,to the other house,858,1533
5,It was on that,862,1251
5,burning to the ground,863,1090
5,because of the way,869,2834
5,to write in the,870,873
5,still there when I,876,2903
5,back in any case,876,2903
5,that it might be,881,2900
5,this new habit of,882,2467
5,too even if I,888,1513
5,on the floor of,1527,2208
5,why this reminds me,889,3003
5,this reminds me of,889,2439
5,to be able to,1231,2981
5,to make use of,3217,3477
5,the gold coins that,895,2131
5,Rembrandt 's cat was,901,3185
5,it so happens that,902,2132
5,to think of Aristotle,905,906
5,chewing on a pencil,907,918
5,it is doubtless not,910,2380
5,in fact there are,915,2666
5,in the painting by,916,1885
5,The Rape of Helen,917,1273
5,I still can not,921,2941
5,practically three thousand years,925,2343
5,when he was still,932,1827
5,Still for some reason,935,1672
5,it strikes me as,935,1965
5,affair with Jane Avril,935,1970
5,some of the other,936,3254
5,would also appear to,940,1934
5,no idea how one,940,2583
5,of course Even if,948,2630
5,the cat outside of,950,2128
5,that I was not,951,1147
5,should one wish to,954,1905
5,Although perhaps this is,956,1789
5,possibly what I have,956,1937
5,there having been no,956,1607
5,at the side of,958,1772
5,to be thinking about,963,2303
5,I was typing that,963,1108
5,Surely one can not,964,2293
5,Actually all I had,967,2098
5,all I had been,967,3580
5,Although I do not,968,1303
5,I am also now,969,3416
5,on the afternoon when,1542,3000
5,this is of course,977,2498
5,Even after I had,979,2106
5,For some time I,981,1327
5,manner in which I,985,1413
5,make an educated guess,987,1490
5,that would appear to,989,1231
5,would appear to remain,989,1351
5,in this house are,991,2830
5,not appear to be,995,3751
5,In which case the,997,1476
5,as a sort of,997,3112
5,by the same painter,999,1002
5,that I have been,1016,1195
5,there might be any,1017,3639
5,in the Borghese Gallery,1023,1077
5,I signed a mirror,1023,2448
5,I am assuming that,1035,3405
5,it is not even,1036,1859
5,that I had never,1043,1229
5,would have wished to,2979,3117
5,make use of the,1048,3217
5,in and out of,1049,1503
5,the thought of this,1055,1504
5,has always saddened me,1055,1504
5,I was surprised that,1056,2635
5,I did not stop,1057,2793
5,how long the embankment,1059,1650
5,more real than the,1061,2909
5,I do not feel,1069,1109
5,have to go back,1072,1483
5,in the painting is,1076,3179
5,at all when one,1086,2761
5,Which in either case,1089,2091
5,I no longer had,1096,1392
5,the way I had,1099,3214
5,one would wish to,1101,3533
5,carry to a spring,1101,3425
5,case doubtless I was,1105,1262
5,my feeling this way,1105,1108
5,I could look back,1107,1925
5,it all over again,1108,2318
5,at the boat basin,1119,1179
5,of one 's baggage,1125,2979
5,all of these people,1127,2507
5,I have just now,1131,1890
5,morning when I was,1132,1682
5,I have mentioned being,1133,2836
5,life of Brahms and,3745,3763
5,condition of being startled,1140,1147
5,and which I had,1141,3486
5,at all that I,1143,1323
5,when I say it,1144,2654
5,I was not really,1147,3346
5,by David Alfaro Siqueiros,1149,2961
5,that it had been,1152,1214
5,any number of other,1153,1153
5,which I had not,1162,2594
5,let myself into the,1163,3040
5,had not begun to,1167,1168
5,morning on which I,1168,2852
5,All I did was,1169,2840
5,And which in fact,1170,2580
5,a history of music,1170,1223
5,certainly I would have,1174,3018
5,I have brought in,1190,3729
5,the path to the,1195,1242
5,that I am dismantling,1196,1246
5,in much the same,1199,1750
5,that I no longer,1205,1392
5,I can not imagine,1206,1860
5,as a tool for,1210,1210
5,I seem to have,1217,1933
5,what I have been,1925,3122
5,In the meantime I,2002,3452
5,I have also been,1223,3331
5,life of Brahms ?,1223,2386
5,in trying to simulate,1224,1845
5,have now and again,1226,3068
5,board by board and,1231,1233
5,quite some time before,1231,3681
5,think in walking past,1233,1239
5,one can still see,1237,2451
5,house in which I,1237,1431
5,that I used to,1240,2644
5,For some period I,1241,3372
5,it is by having,1243,2314
5,on the night that,1249,1250
5,too now that I,1254,3728
5,that I woke up,1255,2687
5,I woke up in,1255,1262
5,beside the Pont Neuf,1255,1260
5,periods when I was,1258,1258
5,Almost every one of,1268,2178
5,one of the books,1268,1592
5,fact I am quite,1273,2978
5,is said to have,1279,1562
5,if one wishes to,1279,2117
5,one word of it,1280,1578
5,The things one knows,1282,1830
5,is the scene in,1284,1445
5,Although I believe I,1286,1305
5,a single one of,1288,2378
5,more often than not,1291,3720
5,that I was feeling,1295,2102
5,the latter having been,1304,2057
5,had a pet seagull,1312,2747
5,The cat in the,1313,3179
5,that I am writing,1314,1610
5,What I more exactly,1317,3465
5,had gotten rid of,1323,2979
5,gotten rid of my,1323,2669
5,one day I had,1324,1351
5,I had been looking,1324,1383
5,And on third thought,1332,2699
5,think about it although,1333,1724
5,I mean is that,1333,1996
5,did or did not,1334,1463
5,do a painting of,1334,2981
5,the same pope who,1336,1339
5,a way in which,1337,1879
5,possibly it was only,1339,2118
5,was not the same,1339,2234
5,that any of these,1340,1347
5,what I more truthfully,1340,1558
5,people in this world,1347,2835
5,eating one 's lunch,1350,3694
5,I have no intention,1361,2845
5,what I wrote about,1361,2489
5,is now in my,1363,1908
5,before I came back,1364,2649
5,I do not often,1365,3744
5,In fact I was,1370,1463
5,able to locate the,1372,3750
5,when I say I,1375,3256
5,away from the town,1376,1387
5,I decided to do,1383,1757
5,to do so that,1383,2408
5,past that fallen tree,1391,1451
5,of the roof of,1394,1645
5,It is likely that,1395,2682
5,appear to indicate that,1397,3170
5,a view of the,1400,1400
5,little more than an,1402,1420
5,was to see if,1404,1569
5,equidistant from each other,1409,2349
5,the person who wrote,1410,2985
5,who wrote the instructions,1410,2001
5,walk through the woods,1416,1528
5,distinctly remember the poster,1424,1533
5,Then again what one,1436,3129
5,what one is now,1436,3175
5,of Anna Karenina in,1437,2706
5,twelve or fifteen years,1440,1441
5,about T. E. Shaw,1443,1612
5,T. E. Shaw and,1443,2790
5,T. E. Shaw was,1443,2802
5,I have just eaten,1455,1904
5,give almost anything for,1457,1458
5,that it was Odysseus,1460,1514
5,None of which has,1471,1872
5,to do with the,2109,2146
5,with the fact that,1471,2723
5,that there is no,1471,2129
5,the identical book in,1473,1731
5,Martin Heidegger after all,1474,2692
5,the question of the,1475,1626
5,would have been more,2909,3209
5,Have I mentioned that,1498,3781
5,Once in the National,1500,1883
5,could have scarcely been,1501,3762
5,of course what with,1501,1659
5,why so many people,1502,3422
5,Hector 's little boy,1506,1589
5,in regard to this,1508,2818
5,A few days ago,1509,1848
5,that Alexander the Great,1509,1511
5,for that matter that,1510,2299
5,I have also now,1513,1959
5,I have forgotten what,1513,1673
5,that any number of,1519,2273
5,I decided to walk,1528,2891
5,able to verify that,1533,2226
5,that I had ever,1533,2733
5,it was on the,1535,1683
5,on the wall in,1535,1535
5,I was seeing was,1536,3326
5,read one word of,2606,3618
5,I did once read,1547,2204
5,after all which I,1547,2822
5,if he had been,1551,1569
5,I would have liked,1556,3026
5,is because of the,1559,2834
5,that she was sensible,1560,1561
5,who had been a,1561,2151
5,had been a child,1561,2684
5,also played an instrument,1563,2751
5,while I was at,1569,2898
5,even if one does,1572,2163
5,now and again become,1572,2744
5,I bring this up,1587,2737
5,he was supposed to,1593,3383
5,I did read a,1595,2661
5,out of a window,1598,2676
5,to begin with but,1606,2084
5,the footnote was in,1608,1613
5,one would have never,1609,2049
5,that T. E. Shaw,1610,2805
5,even though I have,1610,3750
5,was in no way,1613,3038
5,Maria Callas singing that,1614,1715
5,across one of the,1615,1763
5,and so had not,1615,3187
5,up with Vincenzo Bellini,1617,1712
5,still another person I,1623,2620
5,had to have been,1627,1649
5,Andrea Mantegna 's brother-in-law,1628,1712
5,filled with picture postcards,1630,2533
5,explanation for why it,1633,3186
5,as soon as the,1635,3212
5,I had already gotten,1636,2892
5,that my shoulder had,1638,1639
5,I have been driving,1641,3222
5,all I was thinking,1641,2181
5,that I was thinking,1645,2699
5,as to whether the,1647,2830
5,appeared to have been,1650,2660
5,As a general rule,1651,2814
5,below the Borghese Gallery,1663,2946
5,the rest of my,1667,3795
5,put on the shirt,1669,1709
5,while I was waiting,1669,1670
5,this was because the,1674,2613
5,question as to whether,1677,2830
5,in no way a,1678,3038
5,on the back of,1914,2371
5,I had been equally,1695,3745
5,believe that I was,1698,1980
5,had no idea that,1702,2157
5,would have hardly been,1707,3105
5,I had already put,1709,1853
5,being still another person,1712,2620
5,to eat his pigments,1716,1894
5,Flaubert once wrote Maupassant,1721,1722
5,same letter to Brahms,1724,1725
5,only part of the,1725,3518
5,to Alfred North Whitehead,1725,2685
5,would have even been,1735,3112
5,to go into exile,1736,1738
5,Then again I have,1749,2533
5,reason to mention them,1753,1754
5,tennis balls that I,1758,1759
5,have lost their bounce,1760,1761
5,hit tennis balls across,1763,1767
5,that one of them,1767,2249
5,well in spite of,1768,2519
5,the same thing as,1775,2672
5,part of the time,1776,3518
5,I have not forgotten,1777,2320
5,hitting the tennis balls,1778,1840
5,at the beach I,1781,1782
5,that the tape deck,1784,2671
5,was ever able to,1805,2226
5,Just the other morning,1810,1814
5,been thinking about it,1813,2834
5,had to begin to,1813,2794
5,when I typed those,1813,2764
5,from the Cross at,1814,1885
5,a painting in the,1818,2452
5,in either case was,1822,2091
5,was that I had,1822,3029
5,I would keep on,1823,2206
5,thinking about Les Troyens,1823,2303
5,can not see the,1832,3693
5,in The Last Supper,1834,2344
5,it was somebody else,1837,2749
5,whom I do not,1838,3489
5,with the life of,1842,2383
5,life of Samuel Butler,1842,1843
5,read a life of,1843,2661
5,positive I have never,1843,3339
5,trying to simulate seagulls,1845,3766
5,any number of the,1863,3731
5,When my mother was,1864,3588
5,when he took away,1866,2345
5,a few pages ago,1876,2635
5,way in which the,1879,2834
5,the painting itself is,1880,2453
5,Even if as I,1887,2635
5,is not something I,1888,2077
5,I was eating myself,1895,1895
5,was mad he once,1896,2060
5,in Van Gogh 's,1899,3439
5,mean to give any,1900,1922
5,incidentally even if I,1900,2929
5,connected to the subject,1901,1902
5,I might have worn,1909,1910
5,it would have always,1911,1912
5,And in any event,1919,2282
5,I have been writing,1925,2389
5,is that I once,1931,3231
5,one of these figures,1939,2376
5,quite possibly the only,1956,2745
5,did not have children,1957,1975
5,what I have also,1959,2859
5,been the first person,1964,2977
5,perhaps it is the,1969,3423
5,who did not have,1975,2757
5,I do wish that,1987,2795
5,a great deal of,1988,2529
5,is that it was,1996,2812
5,too as it happens,2000,2460
5,I felt like doing,2004,3458
5,the garbage disposal area,2009,2109
5,Have I said that,2007,2410
5,is one more thing,2009,3223
5,In fact the entire,2025,2703
5,would not have thought,2026,2029
5,he would not have,2029,2222
5,all of those swirls,2032,2417
5,garbage disposal area in,2035,2413
5,would have to be,2037,3477
5,when I have built,2040,2041
5,that Alfred North Whitehead,2053,3440
5,as well have been,2067,2249
5,it is not something,2077,2668
5,Although what I would,2088,3771
5,to suggest that there,2091,2770
5,would have been any,2091,2902
5,would have been leery,2095,3401
5,a considerable number of,2097,3244
5,in Corinth New York,2099,2109
5,what it was that,2102,3578
5,was that I was,2102,2704
5,there was a cat,2118,3420
5,subject for a book,2122,3075
5,I have perhaps said,2124,3230
5,up a name for,2128,3205
5,is connected to the,2131,2180
5,In fact now that,2133,2818
5,I did remember to,2134,3319
5,with Rembrandt having been,2136,2146
5,Even if russet is,2137,2358
5,a color that has,2138,2138
5,Willem de Kooning 's,2221,2371
5,Willem de Kooning was,2300,2334
5,the afternoon on which,2145,2533
5,for Willem de Kooning,2146,2221
5,the cat 's name,2146,2365
5,de Kooning would have,2147,2178
5,might not have been,2150,2333
5,from somebody who had,2150,2151
5,a pupil of Rembrandt,2156,2334
5,many people would have,2153,3422
5,did not have any,2156,2757
5,was a pupil of,2323,2975
5,Willem de Kooning himself,2159,2325
5,the man who taught,2160,2325
5,have been mentioned in,2162,3403
5,had a pupil named,2170,2177
5,seem to remember that,2177,2283
5,even though I would,2177,3625
5,admired about Van Gogh,2182,2695
5,could make even a,2182,2695
5,Cezanne once said that,2183,2430
5,painted like a madman,2183,2430
5,scratching at my window,2187,2187
5,one of them ever,2211,2718
5,a solitary thought to,2211,3526
5,that Willem de Kooning,2219,2365
5,that Carel Fabritius was,2219,2221
5,having been descended from,2219,2325
5,that I myself have,2220,2426
5,questions in art history,2225,2250
5,Carel Fabritius may have,2226,2928
5,does happen to be,2231,3137
5,Or at any rate,2240,3604
5,Even if there was,2244,2696
5,has always had to,2250,2834
5,that Rembrandt and Spinoza,2251,2482
5,certainly they would have,2253,2498
5,they would have exchanged,2253,2502
5,on an occasion when,2262,3764
5,think about Taddeo Gaddi,2264,2266
5,made to think about,2265,2267
5,to think about that,2265,3186
5,happened to be a,2269,2771
5,about a man who,2274,3075
5,have gone through life,2277,3614
5,I did not even,2280,2479
5,in any event the,2282,3674
5,about it the more,2283,3016
5,to be equidistant from,2291,2293
5,a pupil of the,2299,2323
5,the tortoise could go,2310,2312
5,would still always be,2310,2312
5,I knew knew that,2311,3587
5,only the tiniest fraction,2312,2312
5,was not that I,2321,3726
5,Except that what I,2323,3602
5,that what I am,2323,3785
5,the person who was,2323,2323
5,And when Bertrand Russell,2327,3062
5,the perfect circle freehand,2339,3690
5,for all of those,2344,3574
5,Rembrandt and Carel Fabritius,2352,2355
5,is that I do,2354,2692
5,have any idea what,2354,2930
5,necessary for me to,2355,2735
5,would give to a,2358,2614
5,of these cats is,2361,3184
5,fact Willem de Kooning,2362,2373
5,Vincent Van Gogh the,2367,2367
5,single one of them,2378,2598
5,Aeschylus 's bald head,2392,2394
5,is something else that,2413,2822
5,Except that in this,2414,3076
5,I have not yet,2414,2831
5,the fire either but,2416,2427
5,that I am not,2420,2714
5,called The Broken Bottles,2421,3436
5,is only a reproduction,2424,2428
5,started to say I,2426,3578
5,and which has now,2426,3657
5,Although what I have,2427,2882
5,as well because of,2444,2508
5,which as I have,2461,2659
5,I have said is,2461,2822
5,would appear to exist,2472,2527
5,on these pages as,2472,2508
5,certain things that one,2481,3522
5,does not happen to,2481,2836
5,a different sort of,2487,3435
5,is something I did,2490,2915
5,fact I believe I,2493,2756
5,Then again perhaps it,2494,2904
5,El Greco and Cervantes,2496,2498
5,Even if El Greco,2497,2498
5,would have been called,2504,2505
5,have been called of,2505,2807
5,called of the Cross,2505,2632
5,So that even if,2510,3594
5,I had not thought,2510,2630
5,the pain in my,2868,2869
5,I have mentioned it,2524,3340
5,one more thing I,2525,3223
5,would have been still,2526,3413
5,it would appear to,2527,3139
5,One would appear to,2529,2916
5,I woke up with,2530,2687
5,the pain is arthritic,2532,2554
5,even though I did,2533,3509
5,downstairs in the basement,2541,2591
5,One would hardly go,2543,3777
5,I was down there,2544,2553
5,I have mentioned that,2546,3179
5,is arthritic after all,2554,2868
5,in the basement which,2554,2986
5,on the day before,2555,2857
5,part of the house,2558,2559
5,I have no real,2560,3723
5,very little to do,2562,3642
5,no reason whatsoever for,2563,2591
5,I have mentioned the,3178,3343
5,to have thought of,2573,3415
5,Or in any event,2584,3674
5,which was the same,2584,3477
5,one of the cartons,2585,2586
5,of the cartons before,2585,2587
5,in the basement with,2591,2686
5,And in which instance,2593,3160
5,look through the books,2594,2595
5,in any event so,2595,3199
5,In fact I suspect,2605,3487
5,from the carton were,2610,2731
5,of these was a,2611,2713
5,amount of difficulty in,2612,3270
5,the chief reason I,2624,3257
5,of the Cross and,2631,2632
5,if one could have,2636,3679
5,reminded me of that,2644,3415
5,books by Martin Heidegger,2652,2658
5,even if it may,2660,3345
5,it has ever been,2661,3479
5,a thing one does,2664,2792
5,I have not read,2665,2665
5,read the back of,2665,2723
5,I do know about,2673,2990
5,on another level altogether,2678,2794
5,might very well have,2734,3159
5,must have said to,2688,3375
5,ought to have been,2689,3540
5,you could actually see,2690,2740
5,that I do know,2692,2990
5,Vincent Van Gogh and,2693,3718
5,on third thought it,2699,3621
5,by now there could,2702,3796
5,one word of German,2709,3234
5,in any way whatsoever,2711,3174
5,necessarily mean that I,2717,2718
5,mean that I am,2717,2973
5,I would not be,2723,3652
5,be familiar with the,2723,3224
5,I did not recognize,2728,2731
5,German writers after all,2731,2735
5,perhaps it was not,2735,3532
5,Well or because of,2738,2956
5,on their minds than,2743,3374
5,that quite possibly the,2745,3650
5,This would be the,2746,2870
5,is that I may,2749,2894
5,In fact I believe,2756,3742
5,Lawrence of Arabia however,2770,2798
5,Lawrence of Arabia had,2772,2922
5,made the assumption that,2773,3563
5,that Lawrence of Arabia,2778,2805
5,the fact that the,2782,3273
5,Nonetheless one is still,2783,3101
5,to Lawrence of Arabia,2788,2796
5,came to the name,2790,2793
5,name happened to be,2799,3284
5,at least it would,2800,3139
5,he was not a,2800,2976
5,Lawrence of Arabia was,2805,2811
5,is that when one,2808,2812
5,But in the meantime,2811,3210
5,the last book from,2811,2812
5,have said that I,2815,3464
5,never been able to,2815,3742
5,putting books into a,2817,2818
5,even if for some,2818,3666
5,books into a bathtub,2818,2819
5,only this tardily come,2822,3386
5,something else that has,2822,3652
5,and having no idea,2824,3471
5,no idea what it,2824,3755
5,Doubtless I have not,2832,3738
5,that quite possibly there,2838,2840
5,at this very instant,2843,2846
5,on its own part,2874,3635
5,Oh And I have,2896,3787
5,it might have been,2904,2925
5,to be put in,2922,3137
5,now made me remember,2929,2930
5,I have said it,2939,3394
5,whatever became of my,2942,2962
5,the smoke from my,2943,3326
5,I have just mentioned,2944,3449
5,Although it is the,2955,3145
5,carton in the basement,2986,3380
5,carrying an old sock,2998,3000
5,in fact on the,3000,3201
5,I have thought about,3016,3588
5,would have been excited,3019,3422
5,that I had just,3029,3267
5,I have decided to,3045,3046
5,would have thought about,3045,3046
5,would have doubtless been,3047,3161
5,sailed to Troy in,3048,3049
5,on his own part,3060,3235
5,reason for the war,3064,3067
5,So that when one,3069,3517
5,here is that I,3082,3652
5,even if that is,3088,3275
5,Well or vice versa,3090,3333
5,fact what I have,3102,3105
5,One had been forgetting,3126,3164
5,Cassandra would have brought,3131,3135
5,a cat would have,3133,3133
5,Even if a cat,3133,3502
5,And which is surely,3143,3479
5,had left the table,3161,3165
5,that very likely it,3175,3504
5,Then again I may,3182,3404
5,as having been russet,3182,3184
5,of Rembrandt 's cat,3184,3223
5,even though I had,3186,3489
5,talking about and which,3191,3740
5,a name for your,3205,3371
5,in the meantime what,3210,3446
5,about that question of,3223,3419
5,I once spoke with,3231,3232
5,the Queen of England,3248,3269
5,of the people I,3258,3282
5,with such people as,3260,3403
5,cat was not really,3273,3488
5,cat being what I,3278,3495
5,to write those letters,3281,3283
5,I have asked myself,3323,3324
5,Although in the meantime,3334,3452
5,I have heard it,3341,3342
5,And which in the,3365,3494
5,that he would remember,3383,3384
5,one 's self in,3388,3531
5,so many other cats,3399,3486
5,lived in a convent,3404,3405
5,there might have been,3414,3763
5,what I am also,3416,3623
5,what I have just,3446,3546
5,sitting at the typewriter,3454,3456
5,fact I have been,3462,3754
5,I once had another,3484,3485
5,being what I would,3495,3506
5,I would say when,3495,3496
5,Adam or I would,3496,3507
5,mad in the least,3516,3664
5,not been able to,3531,3750
5,one had done that,3544,3544
5,it was one 's,3559,3561
5,When all I had,3580,3723
5,I was alone obviously,3583,3623
5,one bit of that,3591,3722
5,So that what I,3605,3785
5,people who write novels,3608,3609
5,the only person in,3618,3619
5,an absolutely autobiographical novel,3621,3623
5,that it could be,3623,3624
5,sooner or later cross,3645,3646
5,manner of being alone,3647,3647
5,So that I am,3653,3729
5,to a world without,3667,3667
5,some time before that,3681,3739
5,Franz Schubert 's ghost,3701,3702
5,mentioned that I have,3738,3781
5,wearing the soccer shirt,3754,3755
5,to move the typewriter,3793,3799
5,I have no idea,934
5,I believe I would,5
5,I suspect I may,3254
5,which was actually a,13
5,when I was at,21
5,the first World War,25
5,By which I mean,1082
5,There is only one,794
5,I do not even,2718
5,I was at the,1569
5,to the ground I,1233
5,to think about it,3728
5,with nobody driving it,69
5,rolling down a hill,3651
5,an explanation for the,70
5,in either case I,1124
5,I may have made,830
5,is an explanation for,813
5,one is apt to,77
5,lashed to the mast,82
5,Rogier van der Weyden,1344
5,Descent from the Cross,1344
5,lighted along the shore,3785
5,that sort of thing,1490
5,as long ago as,3583
5,a manner of speaking,1375
5,for all that I,127
5,for instance which I,868
5,the sun go down,1327
5,would not have been,2807
5,I read the plays,148
5,not have to be,766
5,one word of Russian,2709
5,do not have any,2762
5,I happen to be,167
5,say that I was,951
5,I was looking for,1161
5,all of those other,3407
5,whether I have mentioned,179
5,I have no recollection,1647
5,I have just been,2581
5,about Lawrence of Arabia,265
5,Lawrence of Arabia did,265
5,monstrosity of a canvas,283
5,to raise wind for,3098
5,the sort of thing,298
5,men used to do,298
5,central staircase in the,2870
5,Perhaps I have not,316
5,I have not indicated,1925
5,one of the rooms,3744
5,down the Spanish Steps,3638
5,there must have been,624
5,now that I think,3182
5,I think about it,2283
5,brought me to this,3036
5,of the sound of,385
5,at the Colosseum was,2112
5,all of that looking,1304
5,that I could not,3528
5,was just a phrase,3614
5,think about it I,1666
5,there is no connection,2129
5,all of this time,2389
5,I have just said,1516
5,upside down in the,453
5,comes down to it,3517
5,my mother and father,1045
5,on the second floor,484
5,the point being that,3090
5,I happen to believe,1342
5,if I have not,1999
5,I am able to,518
5,able to see then,3678
5,at the time when,796
5,Conversely I have no,1487
5,sort of thing that,2399
5,that it might not,558
5,the house in the,580
5,nobody at the window,642
5,at the Eiffel Tower,3694
5,who is to argue,2838
5,window in the painting,633
5,attention to a word,3553
5,the books in the,2584
5,would have had no,2157
5,one of them was,649
5,that the painting is,2421
5,the painting is not,3749
5,the room with the,2383
5,I am still feeling,1302
5,what exactly was I,840
5,I am thinking about,1475
5,a guide to the,3422
5,to the birds of,1128
5,that I was making,709
5,Although doubtless I had,3279
5,I had been feeling,3592
5,feeling out of sorts,1492
5,believe I have mentioned,1838
5,to the other in,1801
5,the Four Last Songs,1837
5,In either event it,1790
5,in the basement of,2586
5,eight or nine cartons,2828
5,books in the basement,2573
5,I have never read,1126
5,have more than once,2565
5,although it is not,2668
5,appear to have been,3364
5,person at the window,830
5,to say was that,1974
5,fact I have now,2300
5,there is nothing in,1429
5,have driven right past,1451
5,have been able to,2606
5,I knocked over the,858
5,pays attention to a,863
5,writing in the sand,877
5,to say that the,3456
5,make use of a,1243
5,any number of times,2559
5,one has no idea,1155
5,made me think about,2264
5,to say that I,2714
5,I certainly would have,963
5,an image of myself,1030
5,believe I would have,1044
5,that The Last Supper,1075
5,a painting of a,2981
5,I have not mentioned,1753
5,one would have surely,1519
5,Doubtless this is only,1812
5,to do with my,1105
5,And in either event,2897
5,in either event I,2530
5,have no idea what,2388
5,I happened to be,2303
5,the question of my,2132
5,house that I am,3740
5,is no more than,1212
5,no more than one,2780
5,written for children and,1223
5,I now remember that,3698
5,I find it interesting,2406
5,what I am now,3447
5,now thinking about is,3623
5,thinking about is the,1876
5,very likely it was,3175
5,is the art of,2028
5,in the history of,1961
5,to be confused with,3184
5,the road one takes,1387
5,Possibly I did not,1377
5,need to make that,1377
5,is a thing one,2664
5,Although what I was,1895
5,I would appear to,3031
5,no life of Brahms,3763
5,The title of the,2495
5,of the life of,2819
5,forced to wonder is,2385
5,the way it does,2593
