IN THE BEGINNING, sometimes I left messages in the street.

Somebody is living in the Louvre, certain of the messages would say. 
Or in the National Gallery.

Naturally they could only say that when I was in Paris or in London. 
Somebody is living in the Metropolitan Museum, being what they would say when I was still in New York.

Nobody came, of course. 
Eventually I stopped leaving the messages.

To tell the truth, perhaps I left only three or four messages altogether.

I have no idea how long ago it was when I was doing that.
If I were forced to guess, I believe I would guess ten years.

Possibly it was several years longer ago than that, however.

And of course I was quite out of my mind for a certain period too, back then.

I do not know for how long a period, but for a certain period.

Time out of mind. 
Which is a phrase I suspect I may have never properly understood, now that I happen to use it.

Time out of mind meaning mad, or time out of mind meaning simply forgotten?

But in either case there was little question about that madness. 
As when I drove that time to that obscure corner of Turkey, for instance, to visit at the site of ancient Troy.
