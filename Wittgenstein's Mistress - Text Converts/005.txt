And for some reason wished especially to look at the river
there, that I had read about as well, flowing past the citadel to
the sea.
I have forgotten the name of the river, which was actually a
muddy stream.
And at any rate I do not mean to the sea, but to the
Dardanelles, which used to be called the Hellespont.
The name of Troy had been changed too, naturally. Hisarlik,
being what it was changed to.
In many ways my visit was a disappointment, the site being

Even in late spring, there was snow on the mountain.

stories. Paris, perhaps.
I mean the Paris who had been Helen's lover, naturally. And

I was about to add that I even dreamed, for a while, that the
Greek ships were beached there still.
Well, it would have been a harmless enough thing to dream.
From Hisarlik, the water is perhaps an hour's walk away.

across, and then drive on into Europe through Yugoslavia.
Possibly I mean Yugoslavia. In any case on that side of the

On the side where Troy is, one can find a monument where
Achilles was buried, so much longer ago.
Well, they say it is where Achilles was buried.
Still, I find it extraordinary that young men died there in a
war that long ago, and then died in the same place three
