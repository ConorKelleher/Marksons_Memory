thousand years after that.
But be that as it may, I changed my mind about crossing the
Hellespont. By which I mean the Dardanelles. What I did was
pick out a motor launch and go by way of the Greek islands and
Athens, instead.
Even with only a page torn out of an atlas, instead of
maritime charts, it took me only two unhurried days to get to
Greece. A good deal about that ancient war was doubtless
greatly exaggerated.
Still, certain things can touch a chord.
Such as for instance a day or two after that, seeing the
Parthenon by the late afternoon sun.
It was that winter during which I lived in the Louvre, I
believe. Burning artifacts and picture frames for warmth, in a
poorly ventilated room.
But then with the first signs of thaw, switching vehicles when-
ever I ran low on gas, started back across central Russia to
make my way home again.
All of this being indisputably true, if as I say long ago. And if
as I also say, I may well have been mad.
Then again I am not at all certain I was mad when I drove to
Mexico, before that.
Possibly before that. To visit at the grave of a child I had lost,
even longer ago than all of this, named Adam.
Why have I written that his name was Adam?
Simon is what my little boy was named.
Time out of mind. Meaning that one can even momentarily
forget the name of one's only child, who would be thirty by
now?
I doubt thirty. Say twenty-six, or twenty-seven.
Am I fifty, then?
There is only one mirror, here in this house on this beach.
Perhaps the mirror says fifty.
My hands say that. It has come to show on the backs of my
hands.
