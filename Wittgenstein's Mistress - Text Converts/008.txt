1111
first, I burned to the ground. I am still not certain how that
happened, though perhaps I had been cooking. For a moment I
walked to the dunes to urinate, and when I looked back every-
thing was ablaze.
These beach houses are all wood, of course. All I could do
was sit at the dunes and watch it burn. It burned all night.
I still notice the burned house, mornings, when I walk along
the beach.
Well, obviously I do not notice the house. What I notice is
what remains of the house.
One is still prone to think of a house as a house, however,
even if there is not remarkably much left of it.
This one has weathered fairly well, come to think about it.
The next snows will be my third here, I believe.
Probably I should compose a list of where else I have been, if
only for my own edification. I mean beginning with my old loft
in SoHo, before the Metropolitan. And then my trips.
Although doubtless I have lost track of a good deal of that by
now, as well.
I do remember sitting one morning in an automobile with a
right-hand drive and watching Stratford -on -Avon fill up with
snow, which must surely be rare.
Well, and once that same winter being almost hit by a car
with nobody driving it, which came rolling down a hill near
Hampstead Heath.
There was an explanation for the car coming down the hill
with nobody driving it.
The explanation having been the hill, obviously.
That car, too, had a right-hand drive. Although perhaps that
is not especially relevant to anything.
And in either case I may have made an error, earlier, when I
said I left a message in the street saying that somebody was
living in the National Gallery.
Where I lived in London was the Tate Gallery, where so
is many of the paintings by Joseph Mallord William Turner are.
