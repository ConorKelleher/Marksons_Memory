I am quite certain that I lived at the Tate.
There is an explanation for this, too. The explanation being
that one can see the river, from there.
Living alone, one is apt to prefer a view of water.
I have always admired Turner as well, however. In fact his
own paintings of water may well have been a part of what led to
my decision.
Once, Turner had himself lashed to the mast of a ship for
several hours, during a furious storm, so that he could later
paint the storm.
Obviously, it was not the storm itself that Turner intended to
paint. What he intended to paint was a representation of the
storm.
One's language is frequently imprecise in that manner, I have
discovered.
Actually, the story of Turner being lashed to the mast
reminds me of something, even though I cannot remember what
it reminds me of.
I also seem not to remember what sort of a fire I had at the
Tate.
At the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam, I removed The Night
Watch by Rembrandt from its frame when I was keeping warm
there too, incidentally.
I am quite certain I intended to get to Madrid around that
time also, since there is one painting at the Prado by Rogier van
der Weyden, The Descentfrom the Cross, that I had wished to
see again. But for some reason, at Bordeaux, I switched to a car
that was facing back in the other direction.
Then again perhaps I had actually crossed the Spanish
border as far as to Pamplona.
Well, often I did unpremeditated things in those days, as I
have said. Once, from the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, for
no reason except that I had come upon a Volkswagen van full of
them, I let hundreds and hundreds of tennis balls bounce one
after the other to the bottom, every which way possible.
