as when I lived at the Uffizi. Or from the Seine, when I would
carry a pitcher down the quay from the Louvre.
In the beginning I drank only bottled water, naturally.
In the beginning I had accouterments, as well. Such as
generators, for use with electrical heating devices.
Water and warmth were the essentials, of course.
I do not remember which came first, becoming adept at
maintaining fires, and so shedding devices of that sort, or
discovering that one could drink any water one wished again.
Perhaps becoming adept at fires came first. Even if I have
burned two houses to the ground, over the years.
The more recent, as I have noted, was accidental.
Why I burned the first one I would rather not go too deeply
into. I did that quite deliberately, however.
That was in Mexico, on the morning after I had visited poor
Simon's grave.
Well, it was the house we had all lived in. I honestly believed
I had planned to stay on, for a time.
What I did was spill gasoline all over Simon's old room.
Much of the morning I could still see the smoke rise and rise,
in my rearview mirror.
Now I have two enormous fireplaces. Here in this house by
the sea, I am talking about. And in the kitchen an antiquated
potbellied stove.
I have grown quite fond of the stove.
Simon had been seven, by the way.
A variety of berries grow nearby. And less than minutes past
my stream there are various vegetables, in fields that were once
cultivated but are of course now wildly overgrown.
Beyond the window at which I am sitting the breeze is
frisking with ten thousand leaves. Sunlight breaks through the
woods in mottled bright patches.
Flowers grow too, in great profusion.
It is a day for some music, actually, although I have no means
of providing myself with any.
