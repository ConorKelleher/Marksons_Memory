For years, wherever I was, I generally did contrive to play
some. But when I began to get rid of devices I had to give up the
music as well.
Baggage, basically, is what I got rid of. Well, things.
Now and again one happens to hear certain music in one's
head, however.
Well, a fragment of something or other, in any case. Antonio
Vivaldi, say. Or Joan Baez, singing.
Not too long ago I even heard a passage from Les Troyens,
by Berlioz.
When I say heard, I am saying so only in a manner of
speaking, of course.
Still, perhaps there is baggage after all, for all that I believed I
had left baggage behind.
Of a sort. The baggage that remains in one's head, meaning
remnants of whatever one ever knew.
Such as the birthdays of people like Pablo Picasso or
Jackson Pollock, for instance, which I am convinced I might
still recite if I wished.
Or telephone numbers, from all of those years ago.
There is a telephone right here, actually, no more than three
or four steps behind where I am sitting.
Naturally I was speaking about numbers for telephones
which function, however.
In fact there is a second telephone upstairs, near the
cushioned window seat from which I watch the sun go down,
most evenings.
The cushions, like so much else here at the beach, are musty.
Even on the hottest days, one senses the dampness.
Books become ruined by it.
Books being more of the baggage I got rid of, incidentally.
Even if there are still many in this house, that were here when I
arrived.
I should perhaps indicate that there are eight rooms in the
house, although 1 make use of only two or three.
