Actually I did read, at times, over the years. Especially when
I was mad, I read a good deal.
One winter, I read almost all of the ancient Greek plays. As a
matter of fact I read them out loud. And throughout, finishing
the reverse side of each page would tear it from the book and
drop it into my fire.
Aeschylus and Sophocles and Euripides, I turned into
smoke.
In a manner of speaking, one might think of it that way.
In a different manner of speaking, one might declare it was
Helen and Clytemnestra and Electra, whom I did that with.
For the life of me I have no idea why I did that
If! had understood why I was doing that, doubtless I would
not have been mad.
Had I not been mad, doubtless I would not have done it at all.
I am less than positive that those last two sentences make any
particular sense.
In either case neither do I remember where it was, exactly,
that I read the plays and burned the pages.
Possibly it was after I had gone to ancient Troy, which may
have been what put me in mind of the plays to begin with.
Or would reading the plays have been what put me in mind of
going to ancient Troy?
It did run on, that madness.
I was not necessarily mad when I went to Mexico, however.
Surely one does not have to be mad to decide to visit the grave
of one's dead little boy.
But certainly I was mad when I drove the breadth of Alaska,
to Nome, and then pointed a boat across the Bering Strait.
Even if I did seek out charts, that time.
Well, and had once known boats, as well. But still.
Yet after that paradoxically made my way westward across
all of Russia with scarcely any maps at all. Driving out of the
sun each morning and then waiting for it to appear ahead of me
as the day progressed, simply following the sun.
