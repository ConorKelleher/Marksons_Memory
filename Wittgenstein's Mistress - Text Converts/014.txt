[1 7]
Brooding upon Fyodor Dostoievski as I went.
Actually, I was keeping a weather eye out for Rodion
Romanovitch Raskolnikov.
Did I stop at the Hermitage? Why do I not remember if I
stopped in Moscow at all?
Well, quite possibly I drove right past Moscow without
knowing it, not speaking one word of Russian.
When I say not speaking one word, I mean not reading one
either, obviously.
And why did I write that pretentious line about Dostoievski,
when I do not have any notion now if I allotted a moment's
thought to the man?
More baggage, then. At least here and now while I am typing,
if not at that earlier time.
As a matter of fact when I docked the launch after the last
island and went hunting for an automobile again I was possibly
even surprised that they had Russian printing on their license
plates. Having half imagined that I ought to be in China.
Though it strikes me at only this instant that one possesses
certain Chinese baggage too, of course.
Some. There seems no point in illustrating the fact.
Even if I happen to be drinking souchong tea as I say that.
And in either case the Hermitage may be in Leningrad.
Then again there is no question that I was, decidedly, looking
for Raskolnikov.
Using Raskolnikov as a symbol, one can decidedly say that I
was looking for Raskolnikov.
Though one could also say that I was looking for Anna
Karenina, just as readily. Or for Dmitri Shostakovitch.
I was looking when I went to Mexico too, naturally.
Hardly for Simon, since I knew all too well that Simon was in
that grave. Looking for Emiliano Zapata then, perhaps.
Again symbolically, looking for Zapata. Or for Benito
Juarez. Or for David Alfaro Siqueiros.
Looking for anybody, anywhere at all.
