Well, even mad was looking, or for what earthly reason else,
would I have gone wandering off to all of those other places?
And had been looking on every streetcorner in New York
before that, naturally. Even before I moved out of SoHo, had
been looking everywhere in New York.
And so was still looking that winter when I lived in Madrid,
as well.
I am not certain whether I have mentioned my period in
Madrid.
In Madrid I did not live at the Prado, as it turned out. Perhaps
I have suggested that I had thought to do so, but it was too badly
lighted.
It is natural light that I am speaking about in this case,
already having begun to shed most of my devices by then.
Only when the sun is especially fierce can one begin to see
that Rogier van der Weyden the way it wants to be seen.
I can attest to this categorically, having even washed the
windows nearest it.
Where I lived in Madrid was in a hotel. Choosing the one
they had named after Velazquez.
Looking, there, for Don Quixote. Or for El Greco. Or for
Francisco de Goya.
How poetic most Spanish names generally sound. One can
say them over and over.
Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. Marco Antonio Montes de Oca.
Though in fact both of those may be names from Mexico
again.
Looking. Dear heaven, how anxiously I looked.
I do not remember when it was that! stopped looking.
In the Adriatic, when I was on my way from Troy to Greece,
a ketch swooped toward me swiftly, its tall spinnaker taking
noisy wind.
Just imagine how that startled me, and how I felt.
One moment I was sailing, as alone as ever, and a moment
after that there was the ketch.
