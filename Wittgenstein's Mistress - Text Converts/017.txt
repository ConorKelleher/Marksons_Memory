When it is here, it will be here.
When the leaves fall, generally the woods remain barren for a
time before the snows, and I can see all the way to the spring, or
even to the continuation of my path to the highway beyond.
It requires perhaps forty minutes to walk along the highway
to the town.
There are stores, some few, and there is a gas station.
Kerosene is still to be found at the latter.
I rarely make use of my lamps, however. Even when what
seems the last glimmer of sunset is gone, traces still reach the
room I climb upstairs to sleep in.
Through another window at its opposite side the rosy-
fingered dawn awakens me.
Certain mornings the phrase does happen to fit, as a matter of
fact.
The houses along this beach would appear to continue end-
lessly, by the way. In any case infinitely farther than I have
chosen to walk in either direction and still be able to return by
nightfall.
Somewhere I have a flashlight. In the glove compartment of
the pickup truck, possibly.
The pickup truck is at the highway. I suspect that I may have
neglected to run the battery for some time, now.
Doubtless there are still unused batteries at the gas station.
Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz. I no longer have any idea who
she may have been, to tell the truth.
To tell the truth I would be equally hard pressed to identify
Marco Antonio Mantes de Oca.
In the National Portrait Gallery, in London, which is not one
of the museums I chose to live in, I was not able to recognize
eight out of ten of the faces in the portraits. Or even almost that
many of the names, identifying the portraits.
I do not mean in the cases of people like Winston Churchill
or the Bronte sisters or the Queen or Dylan Thomas, obviously.
Still, this saddened me.
