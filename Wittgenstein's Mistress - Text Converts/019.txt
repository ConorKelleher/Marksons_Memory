Gallery, actually, by somebody named Pintoricchio.
I have said that quite badly, I suspect.
One scarcely meaning that where Penelope is doing her
weaving is in the National Gallery. Where she is doing that is
on the island of Ithaca, naturally.
Ithaca being in neither the Adriatic nor the Aegean Sea,
incidentally, but in the Ionian.
The things that do remain in one's head after all.
I should also perhaps point out that the National Gallery and
the National Portrait Gallery are not the same museum, even
though they are both in London.
As a matter of fact they are not the same museum even
though they are both in the same building.
Conversely I know next to nothing about Pintoricchio,
though I once knew a great deal about many painters.
Well, I knew a great deal about many painters for the same
reason that Achilles must surely have known a great deal about
Hector, say.
All I can remember about the painting of Penelope is that
there is a cat in it, however, playing with a ball of yarn.
Doubtless the inclusion of the cat was scarcely innovative on
Pintoricchio's part. Still, it is perhaps agreeable to think about
Penelope with a pet, especially if I have been wrong about her
and the suitors.
I should have also perhaps said long before this that I harbor
sincere doubts that that war did last those ten years.
Or that Helen was the cause of it.
A single Spartan girl, as somebody once called her. After all.
But what I am basically thinking about here is how disap-
pointingly small the ruins of Troy turn out to be.
Like little more than your ordinary city block and only a few
stories in height, practically.
Well, though with people having lived outside of the citadel
too, on the plains.
But still.
