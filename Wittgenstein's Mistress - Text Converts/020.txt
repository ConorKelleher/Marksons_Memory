[23]
In the Odyssey, when she is older, Helen has a splendid
radiant dignity. I read those pages two or three times, where
Odysseus's son Telemachus comes to visit.
Which means I could not have been tearing them out and
dropping them into the fire, as I did when I read the plays.
Meanwhile I have just been to the dunes again. For some
reason while I was peeing I thought about Lawrence of
Arabia.
Well, I can hardly be said to have thought about him, since I
know little more about Lawrence of Arabia than I do about
Pintoricchio. Still, Lawrence of Arabia did come into mind.
I can think of no connection between making a pee and
Lawrence of Arabia.
There is still that frisky breeze. It is early August, possibly.
For a moment, strolling back, I may have been hearing some
Brahms. I would say The Alto Rhapsody, though I doubt that I
remember The Alto Rhapsody.
Doubtless there was a portrait of Lawrence of Arabia at the
National Portrait Gallery.
And now I have the name T. E. Shaw in my head. But it is
one more of those flitting identities that I cannot at all catch
hold of.
None of that troubles me, by the way.
Very little does, as I may or may not have made evident.
Well, how ridiculous under the circumstances, should I let
anything do so.
I do fret now and again, if fret is the word, over an arthritic
shoulder. The left, which at times leaves me moderately
incapacitated.
Sunshine is a help, however.
My teeth, on the other hand, do not speak of fifty years at all.
Knock on wood, about my teeth.
I cannot remember anything about my mother's teeth, trying
to think back. Or my father's.
At any rate perhaps I am no more than forty-seven.
