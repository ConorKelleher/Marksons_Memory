I cannot envision Helen of Troy with dental problems. Or
Clytemnestra with arthritis.
There was Cezanne, of course.
Although it was not Cezanne but was Renoir.
I have no idea, any longer, where any of my own painting
materials may have gotten to, by the way.
Once during these years I did stretch one canvas, actually. A
monstrosity of a canvas, in fact, at least nine feet by five. In fact
I also sized it with no less than four coats of gesso.
And thereafter gazed at it.
Months, I suspect, I gazed at that canvas. Possibly I even
foolishly squeezed out some pigments onto my pallet.
As a matter of fact I believe it was when I went back to
Mexico, that I did that. In the house where I had once lived with
Simon, and with Adam.
I am basically positive that my husband was named Adam.
And then after months of gazing set fire to the canvas with
gasoline one morning and drove away.
Across the wide Mississippi.
Once in a great while I could almost see things in that canvas,
however.
Almost. Achilles, for instance, in his grief after the death of
his friend, when he covered himself with ashes. Or Clytemnestra,
after Agamemnon had sacrificed their daughter to raise wind
for the Greek ships.
I have no idea why Achilles dressing like a girl is a part that I
always liked.
For that matter it was a woman who wrote the Odyssey,
somebody once said.
When I was back in Mexico, all through that winter I could
not rid myself of the old habit of turning my shoes upside down
each morning, so that any scorpions inside might fall out.
Any number of habits died hard, that way. For some years I
continued to find myself locking doors, similarly.
Well, and in London. Frequently taking the trouble to drive
