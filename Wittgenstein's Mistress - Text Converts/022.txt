on the British side of the road.
After his grief, Achilles got even by slaying Hector, although
Hector ran and ran.
I was about to add that this was the sort of thing men used to
do. But after her own grief Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon.
Needing some assistance. But nonetheless.
Something tells me, obliquely, that that may have been one
of the notions I had, for my canvas. Agamemnon at his bath,
ensnared in that net and being stabbed through it.
Heaven only knows why anybody could have wished for
such a bloody subject, however.
As a matter of fact whom I really may have thought to paint
was Helen. At one of the burned -out boats along the strand,
when the siege was finally ended, being kept prisoner.
But with that splendid dignity, even so.
To tell the truth it was actually just below the central stair-
case in the Metropolitan, where I set that canvas up. Under
those high skylights where my bullet holes were.
Where I had situated my bed was on one of the balconies,
overlooking that area.
The bed itself I had taken from one of the reconstructed
period rooms, I believe, possibly American Colonial.
What I had done about that chimney I had constructed was
to wire it to the same balconies, so that it would not list.
Though I was still making use of all sorts of devices, in those
days. And so had electric heaters also.
Well, and innumerable lights, particularly where the canvas
was.
A nine -foot brilliantly illuminated Electra, I might have
painted, had I thought about it.
I did not think about it until this immediate instant.
Poor Electra. To wish to murder one's own mother.
Well, all of those people. Wrist deep in it, the lot of them,
when one comes down to that.
Irene Papas would have been an effective Electra, however.
