Well, and for a period several gold pocket watches also, on a
cord around my neck.
Actually somebody wore an alarm clock that very way in a
novel I once read.
I would say it was in The Recognitions, by William Gaddis,
except that I do not believe I have ever read The Recognitions
by William Gaddis.
In any case I am more likely thinking of Taddeo Gaddi, even
though Taddeo Gaddi was a painter and not a writer.
What did I do with those watches, I wonder?
Wore them.
Well. But each of them with an alarm of its own, as well.
What I normally did was set the alarms so that each one of
the watches would ring at a different hour.
I did that for some time. All day long, every hour, a different
watch would ring.
In the evening I would set all fourteen of them all over again.
Except that in that case I would set them to ring simultaneously.
This was before I had learned to depend upon the dawn,
doubtless.
They rarely did that anyway. Ring simultaneously, I mean.
Even when that appeared to be the case, one learned to wait
for those which had not started ringing yet.
When I say they rang, I mean that they buzzed, more truth-
fully.
In a town called Corinth, in Mississippi, which is not near the
Mississippi River, parking a car on a small bridge I divested
myself of the watches.
I believe Corinth. I would need an atlas, to reassure myself.
Actually, there is an atlas in this house. Somewhere. Perhaps
in one of the rooms I have stopped going into.
For an entire day I sat in the car and waited for each watch to
ring in its turn.
And then dropped each as it did so into the water. Whatever
body of water that may have been.
