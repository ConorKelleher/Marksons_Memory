[28]
One or two did not ring. What I did was reset them and sleep
in the car and then get rid of those when they rang for morning.
Still ringing like all of the rest when I discarded them.
To tell the truth, I did that in a town somewhere in Pennsyl-
vania. The name of the town was Lititz, Pennsylvania.
All of this was some time before I rolled the tennis balls down
the Spanish Steps in Rome, by the way.
I make the connection between getting rid of the watches and
rolling the tennis balls down the Spanish Steps because I am
positive that getting rid of the watches also occurred before I
saw the cat, which was likewise in Rome.
When I say that I saw a cat I mean that I believed I saw one,
naturally.
And the reason I am positive that this happened in Rome is
because it happened at the Colosseum, which is indisputably in
that city.
Where I believed I saw the cat was at one of the archways in
the Colosseum, quite far up.
How I felt. In the midst of all that looking.
And so went scurrying to a supermarket for canned cat food.
As quickly as I realized I could not locate the cat again, that
would have been.
And then every morning for a week, opened cans by the
carton and went about setting them out on the stone seats.
As many cans as there must have been Romans watching the
Christians, practically.
But next speculated that the cat might possibly reappear only
at night, being frightened, and so rigged up yet another
generator and floodlights, even.
Though of course I had no way of telling if the cat had nibbled
at any of the food behind my back, since most of the cans had
not seemed quite full to begin with.
Still, I felt that to be unquestionably worth checking on,
several times each day.
What I named the cat was Nero.
