Here, Nero, I would call.
Well, I suspect I may have tried Julius Caesar and Herodotus
and Pontius Pilate at various moments, also.
Herodotus may have been a waste of time with a cat in Rome,
now that I think about it.
Doubtless the cans are still there in either case, lined up
across all of those seats.
Rains would have emptied them completely by now,
assuredly.
Doubtless there was no cat at the Colosseum.
Though I also called the cat Calpurnia, after a time, when it
struck me that I should cover all bases.
Doubtless there was no seagull either.
It is the seagull which brought me to this beach, that I am
speaking about now.
High, high, against the clouds, little more than a speck, but
then swooping in the direction of the sea.
I will be truthful. In Rome, when! thought I saw the cat,! was
undeniably mad. And so I thought I saw the cat.
Here, when I thought I saw the seagull, I was not mad. So I
knew I had not seen the seagull.
Now and again, things burn. I do not mean only when I have
set fire to them myself, but out of natural happenstance. And so
bits and pieces of residue will sometimes be wafted great
distances, or to astonishing heights.
I had finally gotten accustomed to those.
Still, I would have vastly preferred to believe I had seen the
seagull.
As a matter of fact it was much more probably the thought of
sunsets, which brought me to this beach.
Well, or of the sound of the sea.
After I had finally determined that! may as well stop looking,
this is.
Have I mentioned looking in Damascus, Syria, or in
Bethlehem, or in Troy, New York?
