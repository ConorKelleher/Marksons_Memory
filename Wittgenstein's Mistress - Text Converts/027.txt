[30]
Once, near Lake Como, at a stone stairway that reminded me
somewhat of the Spanish Steps, I put several loose coins that
had been lying in my Jeep into a public telephone, intending to
ask for Giovanni Keats.
I had no idea if Keats had ever visited Lake Como, actually.
For some weeks in Mexico I drove a Jeep also. And so was
able to maneuver directly up the hillside, instead of taking the
road, each time I went to the cemetery.
How many different vehicles have I made use of, I suddenly
wonder, since all of this started?
Well, more than one could have kept track of just down to
Cuernavaca or back, surely. What with having to switch at so
many obstacles, even disregarding when one ran out of gas.
By obstacles I most generally mean other cars, naturally. In
whatever nuisance locations they had come to a stop.
And on top of which I always foolishly troubled to transfer all
of my baggage as well, in those days.
Excepting when I was forced to walk too considerable a
distance between one vehicle and the next, of course.
But even then, would repeatedly burden myself with more of
the same in no time.
Here, I have three denim skirts that wrap around, and some
cotton jerseys.
Most of which at the moment are lying across bushes, drying
in the sun.
I drive only rarely now, as well.
As a matter of fact the clothing out at the spring has been dry
for some days.
In autumn, after the leaves have fallen, I would be able to see
it from exactly where I am sitting at this moment, possibly.
The cat at the Colosseum was russet colored, incidentally.
The gull was your ordinary gull.
Actually it was ash, carried astonishingly high and rocked by
breezes.
Every last one of those skirts and jerseys has gotten faded,
