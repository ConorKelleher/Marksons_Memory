I am wearing underpants, but only because the seat of this

Wandering through this endless nothingness. Once in a

Actually I underlined that sentence in a book, named the
Pensees, when I was in college.
Doubtless I underlined the sentence about wandering through
an endless nothingness in somebody else's book, as well.
The cat that Pintoricchio put into the painting of Penelope

Yesterday's sunset was an abstract expressionist sunset. It is
about a week since the last time I had a Turner.
I do not masturbate often. Though at times I do so almost
without being aware of it, actually.
At the dunes, perhaps. Just sitting, being lulled by the surf.
