There is an ebb, is all.
I suspect I have done it while driving too, however.
I am quite certain that I masturbated on a road in La Mancha
once, near a castle that I kept on seeing and seeing, but that I
never appeared to get any closer to.
There was an explanation for not getting any closer to the
castle.
The explanation being that the castle was built on a hill, and
that the road went in a flat circle around the bottom of the hill
that the castle was built on.
Very likely one could have driven around that castle eter-
nally, never actually arriving at it.
Before I ever saw one, I would have supposed that castles in
Spain was just a phrase.
There are castles.
Near someplace called Savona, which is not in Spain but in
Italy, I went off the road, once.
Part of the embankment had fallen away. This is on the
seacoast, that I am talking about, so that if one goes off an
embankment one has gone into water.
Instead of watching a castle I had been watching the water,
doubtless.
As a matter of fact the car turned over.
Only my shoulder hurt, some moments afterward.
Well, the very shoulder that is now arthritic, come to think
about it. I had never made that connection before.
Perhaps there is no connection.
In either case the car also began to fill up with water.
Interestingly, I did not feel frightened in the least. Or perhaps
it was the realization that I had not badly injured myself, which
reassured me.
Still, I understood that opening my door and getting out
would be a sensible notion under the circumstances.
I was not able to open my door.
During all of this time I was on the roof of the car, by the way.
