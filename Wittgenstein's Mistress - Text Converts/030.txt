I mean on the inside of the roof, obviously. And with the
rubber mat from the floor having fallen on top of me.
I do not remember what kind of a car I was driving at the
lime.
Well, one was scarcely driving it any longer in either case.
What I was doing was trying to crawl across to the opposite
door.
The water came up only to the tops of my sandal straps.
Still, the entire experience terrified me.
I am aware that I have just said it had not frightened me in the
least.
As a matter of fact what happened was that it did not frighten
me until it was over.
Once I had climbed back onto the embankment, and could
see the car upside down in the water, it frightened me rather
impressively.
I cannot say with any certainty that I had been masturbating
when I failed to notice the collapsed embankment.
Or whether I had been driving toward Savona, or had already
passed Savona.
What is fairly certain is that I was driving into Italy, and not
out, since in driving into Italy along that coast one would have
the sea at one's right hand, which is the side I went into it from.
Even if I have no recollection whatsoever of ever having
driven into Italy from the direction I am talking about.
Doubtless it is partly age, which blurs such distinctions.
When one comes down to it, I could actually be well past
fifty.
Again, the mirror is of no real help. One would need some
kind of yardstick, or a field of comparison.
There was a tiny, pocket sort of mirror on that same table
beside my mother's bed, those fmal weeks.
You will never know how much it has meant to me that you
are an artist, Kate, she said, one evening.
There are no painting materials in this house.
