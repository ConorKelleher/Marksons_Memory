Actually there was one canvas on a wall, when I came.
Directly above and to the side of where this typewriter is, in
fact.
A painting of this very house, although it took me some days
to recognize that.
Not because it was not a satisfactory representation, but
because I had not happened to look at the house from that
perspective, as yet.
I had already removed the painting into another room by the
time I did so.
Still, I believed it was a painting of this house.
After I had concluded that it was, or that it appeared to be, I
did not go back into the other room to verify my conclusion.
I go into those rooms infrequently, and have closed those
doors.
There was nothing extraordinary in the fact of my closing
them. Possibly I closed them only because I did not feel like
sweeping.
Leaves blow in, and fluffy cottonwood seeds.
This room is quite large. There is a deck outside, constructed
on two sides of the house so that it faces both the forest and the
dunes.
Two of the five closed doors are upstairs.
None of this is counting the bathroom, where the mirror is.
In fact there could well be additional paintings in those other
rooms. I could look.
There are no paintings in the closed rooms. Or at least not in
the three closed rooms that are downstairs.
Though I have just replaced the painting of the house.
It is agreeable to have some art about.
In my mother's living room, in Bayonne, New Jersey, there
were several of my own paintings. Two of those were portraits,
of her and my father.
Never was I able to find the courage to ask her if she wished
me to remove that mirror.
