One afternoon the mirror was no longer there, however.
To tell the truth, I rarely did portraits.
Those of my mother and father are now at the Metropolitan
Museum, in one of the main painting galleries on the second
floor.
Well, all of my paintings are now in those galleries in the
Metropolitan Museum.
What I did was stand them between various canvases in the
permanent collection, wherever there was sufficient wall space.
Some few overlapped those others, but only at their lower
corners, generally.
Very likely a certain amount of warp has occurred in mine
since, however.
From having been leaning for so many years rather than
being hung, that would be.
Well, and a number of them had never been framed, either.
Then again, when I say all of my paintings I am speaking only
about the paintings I had not sold, naturally.
Though in fact some few were in group shows, or out on loan,
also.
One of those I saw by sheer chance when I was in Rome, as a
matter of fact.
Actually I had almost forgotten about it. And then in the
window of a municipal gallery on a street near the Via Vittorio
Veneto, there was my name on a poster.
To tell the truth, it was Louise Nevelson's name that caught
my eye first. But still.
Sitting in an automobile with English license plates and a
right-hand drive, only a day after that, I watched the Piazza
Navona fill up with snow, which must surely be rare.
Early in the Renaissance, although also in Rome, Brunel-
leschi and Donatello went about measuring ruins with such
industry that people believed they were mad.
But after that Brunelleschi returned home to Florence and
put up the largest dome since antiquity.
