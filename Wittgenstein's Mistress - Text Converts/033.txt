Well, this being one of the reasons they named it the Renais-
sance, obviously.
It was Giotto who built the beautiful campanile next door to
that same cathedral.
Once, being asked to submit a sample of his work, what
Giotto submitted was a circle.
Well, the point being that it was a perfect circle.
And that Giotto had painted it freehand.
When my father died, less than a year after my mother, I
came upon that same tiny mirror in a drawer full of old
snapshots.
An authentic snow falls in Rome no more than once every
seventy years or so, as a matter of fact.
Which is approximately how often the Arno overflows its
banks too, at Florence. Though perhaps there is no connection
there.
Yet it is not impossible that people like Leonardo da Vinci or
Andrea del Sarto or Taddeo Gaddi went through their entire
lives without ever watching boys throw snowballs.
Had they been born somewhat later they could have seen
Bruegel's paintings of youngsters doing that, at least.
I happen to believe the story about Giotto and the circle, by
the way. Certain stories being gratifying to believe.
I also believe I met William Gaddis once. He did not look
Italian.
Conversely I do not believe one word of what I wrote, a few
lines ago, about Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Sarto and
Taddeo Gaddi never seeing snow, which was ridiculous.
Nor can I remember, any longer, if I happened onto the
poster with my name on it before or after I saw the cat at the
Colosseum.
The cat at the Colosseum was orange, if! have not indicated,
and had lost an eye.
In fact it was hardly your most appealing cat, for all that I was
so anxious to see it again.
