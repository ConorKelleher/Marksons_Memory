Simon had a cat, once. Which we could never seem to decide
on a name for.
Cat, being all we ever called it.
Here, when the snows come, the trees write a strange callig-
raphy against the whiteness. The sky itself is often white, and
the dunes are hidden, and the beach is white down to the water's
edge, as well.
In a manner of speaking almost everything I am able to see,
then, is like that nine -foot canvas of mine, with its opaque four
white coats of gesso.
Now and again I build fires along the beach, however.
Well, autumns, or in early spring, I am most apt to do that.
Once, after doing that, I tore the pages out of a book and
lighted those too, tossing each page into the breeze to see if the
breeze might make it fly.
Most of the pages fell right next to me.
The book was a life of Brahms, which had been standing
askew on one of the shelves here and which the dampness had
left permanently misshapen. Although it had been printed on
extraordinarily cheap paper to begin with.
When I say that I sometimes hear music in my head, inci-
dentally, I often even know whose voice I am hearing, if the
music is vocal music.
I do not remember who it was yesterday for The Alto
Rhapsody, however.
I had not read the life of Brahms. But I do believe there is one
book in this house which I did read, since I came.
As a matter of fact one could say two books, since it was a
two -volume edition of the ancient Greek plays.
Although where I actually read that book was in the other
house, farther down the beach, which I burned to the ground.
The only book I have looked into in this house is an atlas,
wishing to remind myself where Savona is.
As a matter of fact I did that not ten minutes ago, when I
decided to bring the painting of the house back out here.
