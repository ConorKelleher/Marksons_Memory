Which I now cannot be positive is a painting of this house, or
of a house that is simply very much like this house.
The atlas was on a shelf directly behind where the painting
had been leaning.
And directly beside a life of Brahms, printed on extraordi-
narily cheap paper and standing askew in such a way that it has
become permanently misshapen.
Presumably it was another book altogether, from which I tore
the pages and set fire to them, in wishing to simulate a seagull.
Unless of course there were two lives of Brahms in this
house, both printed on cheap paper and both ruined by
dampness.
Kathleen Ferrier is who was singing The Alto Rhapsody.
I assume I do not have to explain that any version of any
music that comes into my head would be the version I was once
most familiar with.
In SoHo, my recording of The Alto Rhapsody was an old
Kathleen Ferrier recording.
And now that strand of tape is scratching at the window in the
next room again, again sounding like a cat.
One does not name a seagull.
Once, when I was listening to myself read the Greek plays
out loud, certain of the lines sounded as if they had been written
under the influence of William Shakespeare.
One had to be quite perplexed as to how Aeschylus or
Euripides might have read Shakespeare.
I did remember an anecdote, about some other Greek author,
who had remarked that if he could be positive of a life after
death he would happily hang himself to see Euripides. Basically
this did not seem relevant, however.
Finally it occurred to me that the translator had no doubt
read Shakespeare.
Normally I would not consider that a memorable insight,
except for the fact that I was otherwise undeniably mad at the
time when I read the plays.
