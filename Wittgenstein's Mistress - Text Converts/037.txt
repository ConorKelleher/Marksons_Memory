directly descended from some of those other Greeks, when one
stops to think about it.
Surely it would have been easy to lose track, in so many
years. But who is to say that it might not go back even farther
than that, to somebody like Achilles, why not?
I am almost certain that Helen had at least one child, at any
rate.
Now the painting does appear to be of this house.
As a matter of fact there also appears to be somebody at the
very window, upstairs, from which I watch the sunset.
I had not noticed her at all, before this.
If it is a she. The brushwork is fairly abstract, at that point, so
that there is little more than a hint of anybody, really.
Still, it is interesting to speculate suddenly about just who
might be lurking at my bedroom window while I am typing
down here right below.
Well, and on the wall just above and to the side of me, at the
same time.
All of this being merely in a manner of speaking, of course.
Although I have also just closed my eyes, and so could addi-
tionally say that for the moment the person was not only both
and on the wall, but in my head as well. upstairs
Were I to walk outside to where I can see the window, and do
the same thing all over again, the arrangement could become
much more complicated than that.
For that matter I have only now noticed something else in the
painting.
The door that I generally use, coming and going from the
front deck, is open.
Not two minutes ago, I happen to have closed that same
door.
Obviously no action of my own, such as that, changes
anything in the painting.
Nonetheless I have again just closed my eyes, trying to see if
I could imagine the painting with the door to the deck closed.
