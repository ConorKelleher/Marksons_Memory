I was not able to close the door to the deck in the version of
the painting in my head.
Had I any pigments, I could paint it closed in the painting
itself, should this begin to trouble me seriously.
There are no painting materials in this house.
Unquestionably there would have had to be all sorts of such
materials here at one time, however.
Well, with the exception of those that she carried to the
dunes, where else would the painter have deposited them?
Now I have made the painter a she, also. Doubtless because
of my continued sense of it being a she at the window.
But in either case one may still assume that there must be
additional painting materials inside of the house in the painting,
even if one cannot see any of them in the painting itself.
As a matter of fact it is no less possible that there are addi-

Then again, very likely the others could be at the beach, since
it is late on a summer afternoon in the canvas, although no later
than four o'clock.
So that next one is forced to wonder why the woman at the
window did not go to the beach herself, for that matter.
Although on second thought I have decided that the woman
may well be a child.
So that perhaps she had been made to remain at home as a
punishment, after having misbehaved.
Or perhaps she was even ill.
Possibly there is nobody at the window in the canvas.
At four o'clock I will try to estimate exactly where at the
dunes the painter took her perspective, and then see how the
shadows fall, up there.
Even if I will be forced to guess at when it is four o'clock,
there being no clocks or watches in this house, either.
All one will have to do is to match the real shadows on the
house with the painted shadows in the painting, however.
