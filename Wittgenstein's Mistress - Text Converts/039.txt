Although perhaps the real shadows at the window when I go
out will not solve a thing in regard to the painting.
Perhaps I will not go out.
Once, I believed I saw somebody at a real window, while I
am on the subject.
In Athens, this was, and while I was still looking, which made
it something of an occurrence.
Well. And even more so than the cat at the Colosseum,
rather.
As a matter of fact one could also see the Acropolis, from
beside the very window in question.
Which was in a street full of taverns.
Still, when the sun had gotten to the angle from which Phidias
had taken his perspective, the Parthenon almost seemed to
glow.
Actually, the best time to see that is generally also at four
o'clock.
Doubtless the taverns from which one could see that did
better business than the taverns from which one could not, in
fact, even though they were all in the same street.
Unless of course the latter were patronized by people who
had lived in Athens long enough to have gotten tired of seeing it.
Such things can happen. As in the case of Guy de
Maupassant, who ate his lunch every day at the Eiffel Tower.
Well, the point being that this was the only place in Paris
from which he did not have to look at it.
For the life of me I have no idea how I know that. Any more
than I have any idea how I also happen to know that Guy de
Maupassant liked to row.
When I said that Guy de Maupassant ate his lunch every day
at the Eiffel Tower, so that he did not have to look at it, I meant
that it was the Eiffel Tower he did not wish to look at, naturally,
and not his lunch.
One's language being frequently imprecise in such ways, I
have discovered.
