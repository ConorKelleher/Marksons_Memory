Although I have a rowboat of my own, as it happens.
Now and again, I row out a good distance.
Beyond the breakers, the currents will do most of the work.
The row back can be difficult, however, if one allows one's
self to be carried too far.
Actually, the rowboat is my second rowboat.
The first rowboat disappeared.
Doubtless I had not beached it securely enough. One
morning, or possibly one afternoon, it was simply gone.
Some days afterward I walked along the beach farther than I
had ever walked before, but it had not come ashore.
It would scarcely be the only boat adrift, of course, if it is still
adrift.
Well, like that ketch in the Aegean, for starters.
Sometimes I like to believe it has been carried all of the way
across the ocean by now, however. As far as to the Canary
Islands, say, or to Cadiz, on the coast of Spain.
Well, or who is to argue that it might not have gotten to
Scyros itself, even?
I do not remember the name of the street with all of those
taverns in it.
Possibly I never knew the names of any of the streets in
Athens in either case, not speaking one word of Greek.
When I say not speaking one word, I mean not reading one
either, obviously.
One would certainly wish to conceive of the Greeks as
having been imaginative in that regard, however.
Penelope Avenue being an agreeable possibility, for instance.
Or Cassandra Street.
At least there must have been an Aristotle Boulevard, surely.
Or a Herodotus Square.
Why did I imply that it was Phidias who built the Parthenon
when it was somebody named Ictinus?
In spite of frequently underlining sentences in books that had
not been assigned, I did well in college, actually.
