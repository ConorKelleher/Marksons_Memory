strange calligraphy of the spines of the trees, it is a little like
closing one's eyes.
Certainly reality is altered.
One morning you awaken, and all color has ceased to exist.
Everything that one is able to see, then, is like that nine -foot
canvas of mine, with its opaque four white coats of plaster and
glue.
I have said that.
Still, it is almost as if one might paint the entire world, and in
any manner one wished.
Letting one's brushing become abstract at a window, or not.
Though perhaps it was Cassandra whom I had intended to
portray to begin with, on those forty-five square feet, rather
than Electra.
Even if a part I have always liked is when Orestes finally
comes back, after so many years, and Electra does not recognize
her own brother.
What do you want, strange man? I believe this is what
Electra says to him.

It was only the Parthenon, I am quite certain, so beautiful in
the afternoon sun, that had touched a chord.
In Greece, no less, from where all arts and all stories came.
Still, for a time I almost wished to weep.
Perhaps I did weep, that one afternoon.
Though perhaps it was weariness too, behind the veil of
madness that had protected me, and which, that afternoon, had
slipped away.
One afternoon you see the Parthenon, and with that one
glance your madness has momentarily slipped away.
