Weeping, you walk the streets whose names you do not
know, and somebody calls out after you.
I ran into an alley, which was actually a cul-de-sac.
Surely that is you!
I also had a weapon. My pistol, from the skylights.
Well, when I was looking, I almost always carried that.
Looking in desperation, as I have said.
But still, never knowing just whom one might find, as well.
Not until dusk did I emerge from the cul-de-sac.
And saw my own reflection behind the window of an artists'
supplies shop, highlighted there against a small stretched
canvas.
To tell the truth, one book in the shop next door to that one
did happen to be in English.
This was a guide to the birds of Southern Connecticut and
Long Island Sound.
I slept in the car that I was making use of at the time. Which
was a Volkswagen van, filled with musical instruments.
Kathleen Ferrier had very possibly died even before I had
purchased that old recording, I now believe.
I have forgotten whatever point I might have intended to
make by mentioning that, however.
Veil of madness was a terribly pretentious phrase for me to
have written, too.
The next morning I drove counterclockwise, among moun-
tains, toward Sparta, which I wished to visit before departing
Greece.
Not thinking to look into the book on birds for what it might
have told me about seagulls.
Halfway to Sparta, I got my period.
Throughout my life, my period has always managed to
surprise me.
Even in spite of my generally having been out of sorts for
some days beforehand, this is, which I will almost invariably
have attributed to other causes.
