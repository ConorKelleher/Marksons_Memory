way whatsoever of seeing where one is going.
Still, I had believed I was managing. Until such time as the
entire contraption floated away from me.
Possibly it was a wind, which caused that, since there were
many more broken windows in the museum than those I had
broken on purpose, by that time.
Presumably it was a wind from below, in fact, since what the
canvas seemed to do was to rise up in front of me. And then to
rise up some more.
Remarkably soon after that it was underneath me, however.
The pain was excruciating.
I am gushing, being what I thought at first, however. And I do
not even have underpants on, under this wraparound skirt.
To tell the truth, when I had actually thought that had been
perhaps two seconds earlier.
And so had shifted the way in which I was standing, naturally,
to close my thighs.
Forgetting for the same instant that I was carrying forty-five
square feet of canvas, on stretchers, up a stone stairway.
In retrospect it does not even become unlikely that there had
been no wind after all.
And naturally all of this had occurred with what seemed no
warning whatsoever, either.
Although doubtless I had been feeling out of sorts for some
days, which I would have invariably laid to other causes.
The museum of course possessed crutches, and even wheel-
chairs, for just such emergencies.
Well, perhaps not for exactly just such.
All of these were on the main floor, in any event, along with
other first aid items.
It would have been inordinately easier for me to crawl to the
top of the stairs, rather than to the bottom.
Most of my accouterments were down there too, however. I
believe I have mentioned having still possessed accouterments,
in those days.
