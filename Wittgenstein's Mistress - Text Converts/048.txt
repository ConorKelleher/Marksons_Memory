As it turned out, I became astonishingly adept at maneuvering
my wheelchair in next to no time.
Skittering from one end of the main floor to the other, in fact,
when the mood took me.
From the Greek and Roman antiquities to the Egyptian, or
whoosh! and here we go round the Temple of Dendur.
Often even with music by Berlioz, or Igor Stravinsky, to
accompany myself.
Now and again, the same ankle still pains me.
This is generally only in regard to the weather, actually.
For the life of me I cannot remember what I had been trying
to get that canvas up the stairway for, on the other hand.
To paint on it, would be a natural supposition.
Then again, after not having painted on it for months,
perhaps I had wished to put it someplace where I would not
have to be continually reminded that I had not done so.
A canvas nine feet tall and five feet wide being hardly your
most easily ignored reminder.
Doubtless I had had something in mind, at any rate.
There is a tape deck in the pickup truck here, now that I think
about it.
There would appear to be no tapes, however.
Once, changing vehicles beside some tennis courts at
Bayonne, in France, I turned an ignition key and found myself
hearing the Four Serious Songs, by Braluns.
Though I am possibly thinking about the Four Last Songs,
by Richard Strauss.
In either event it was not Kathleen Ferrier singing.
Actually, a fairly high percentage of the vehicles that one
comes upon will have tape decks, many still set to the on
position.
Rarely would it occur to me to give this any attention,
however.
Obviously, one's chief interest at such moments would
concern whether the battery on hand still functioned.
