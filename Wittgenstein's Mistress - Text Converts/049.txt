Assuming one had already determined that there was a key in
the vehicle, and gasoline.
Kirsten Flagstad was singing, at Bayonne. Which was in fact
Bordeaux.
To tell the truth, one was generally pleased enough that a car
was moving so as to have driven some distance before noticing
whether a tape deck was playing or not.
Or at least to have gotten clear of whatever obstacles had
made it necessary to switch vehicles to begin with.
Often, bridges caused such switching. One solitary nuisance
car can render your average bridge impassable.
For some years I normally troubled to transfer my baggage
from one vehicle to the next, as well. On certain trips I even
thought to carry along a hand truck.
When I was living at the Metropolitan I towed clear a
number of my access routes, finally.
Well, or sometimes made use of a Land Rover, and came or
went directly across the lawns in Central Park.
There is no longer any problem in regard to my husband's
name, by the way. Even if I never saw him again, once we
separated after Simon died.
As a matter of fact there is a hand truck in the basement of
this house.
It is not one of my own, since I rarely make use of such con-
trivances any longer. Rather it was there when I came.
There are eight or nine cartons of books in the basement also,
in addition to the many books in the various rooms up here.
The hand truck is badly rusted, as are the several bicycles.
The basement is even more damp than the remainder of the
house. I leave that door closed.
The entrance to the basement is at the rear of the house, and
below a sandy embankment, so that one does not see that in the
painting.
The perspective in the painting having been taken from out in
front, if I have not indicated that.
