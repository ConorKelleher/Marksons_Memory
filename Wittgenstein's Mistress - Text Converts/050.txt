There are several baseballs in the basement also, on a ledge.
There is also a lawnmower, although there is only one
exceedingly small patch of grass, at one side of the house, that I
can imagine ever having been mowed.
That patch, on the other hand, does appear to be discernible
in the painting.
I can see now that it had, in fact, been mowed at the time
when the painter painted it.
The things one tardily becomes aware of.
Which reminds me that I am now convinced that the
sentence that came into my head yesterday, or the day before
yesterday, about wandering through an endless nothingness,
was written by Friedrich Nietzsche.
Even if! am equally convinced that! have never read a single
word written by Friedrich Nietzsche.
I do believe that I once read Wuthering Heights, however,
which I mention because all that I seem able to remember about
it is that people are continually looking in or out of windows.
The book called the Pensees was written by Pascal, by the
way.
I also believe I have not indicated that this is another day of
typing, which is why I expressed hesitation as to whether
quoting Friedrich Nietzsche had occurred yesterday or the day
before yesterday.
I did not make any sort of note about where I stopped, simply
leaving that sheet in the machine.
Possibly I stopped at the point where I came to the baseballs
in the basement, since the topic of baseball has always bored me.
Afterward I went for a walk along the beach, as far as the
other house, which burned.
Yesterday's sunset was a Vincent Van Gogh sunset, with a
certain amount of anxiety in it.
Perhaps I am only thinking about streaks.
I have more than once wondered why the books in the base-
ment are not upstairs with the others, actually.
