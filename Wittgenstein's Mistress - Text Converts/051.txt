There is space. Many of the shelves up here are half empty.
Although doubtless when I say they are half empty I should
really be saying they are half filled, since presumably they were
totally empty before somebody half filled them.
Then again it is not impossible that they were once filled
completely, becoming half empty only when somebody
removed half of the books to the basement.
I find this second possibility less likely than the first,
although it is not utterly beyond consideration.
In either event the present state of the shelves is an explana-
tion for why so many of the books in the house are tilted, or
standing askew. And thus have become permanently mis-
shapen.
Baseball When the Grass Was Real is actually the name of
one of those, I believe.
In that case one is at least made halfway curious about the
meaning of the title, I must admit.
Less than inordinately curious, baseball remaining baseball,
but at least halfway curious.
As a matter of fact perhaps I will mow my own grass, which is
undeniably real, even if it is inordinately overgrown.
I cannot mow the grass. Not with the lawnmower being as
badly rusted as the hand truck and the bicycles.
I have other bicycles, actually.
One is doubtless beside the pickup truck. Another may be at
the gas station, in the town.
There was a bicycle in the cul-de-sac beneath the Acropolis,
come to think about it.
Perhaps the books in the basement are duplicate books.
Like the two lives of Braluns, that would be. Even if both of
those would appear to have been upstairs.
There is nobody at the window in the painting of the house,
by the way.
I have now concluded that what I believed to be a person is a
shadow.
