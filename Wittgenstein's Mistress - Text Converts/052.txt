If it is not a shadow, it is perhaps a curtain.
As a matter of fact it could actually be nothing more than an
attempt to imply depths, within the room.
Although in a manner of speaking all that is really in the
window is burnt sienna pigment. And some yellow ochre.
In fact there is no window either, in that same manner of
speaking, but only shape.
So that any few speculations I may have made about the
person at the window would therefore now appear to be
rendered meaningless, obviously.
Unless of course I subsequently become convinced that there
is somebody at the window all over again.
I have put that badly.
What I intended to say was that I may possibly become
newly convinced that there is somebody at the window, hardly
that somebody who had been at the window has gone away but
might come back.
In either case it remains a fact that no altered perception of •
my own, such as this one, changes anything in the painting.
So that perhaps my earlier speculations remain valid after all.
I have very little idea what I mean by that.
One can scarcely speculate about a person when there is no
person to speculate about.
Yet there is no way of denying that one did make such
speculations.
Two days ago, when I was hearing Kathleen Ferrier, what
exactly was I hearing?
Yesterday, when I was speculating about a person at the
window in the painting, what exactly was I speculating about?
I have just put the painting back into the room with the atlas
and the life of Braluns.
As a matter of fact I have now also had another night's sleep.
I mention that, this time, only because in a manner of
speaking one could now say that it has this quickly become the
day after tomorrow.
