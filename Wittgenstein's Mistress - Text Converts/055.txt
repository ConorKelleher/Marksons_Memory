invented writing in the sand, but only grooves from my stick?
Doubtless the stick was originally nothing more interesting
than the handle of a carpet sweeper.
Once, when I had set it aside to drag a piece of driftwood
along the beach, I worried that I might have lost it.
When I looked back it was standing upright, however, where
I had had the foresight to place it without really paying
attention.
Then again it is quite possible that the question of loss had
not entered my mind until I was already in the process of
looking back, which is to say that the stick was already not lost
before I had worried that it might be.
I am not particularly happy over this new habit of saying
things that I have very little idea what I mean by saying, to tell
the truth.
It was somebody named Ralph Hodgson, who wrote the
poem about the birds being sold in the shops for people to eat.
I do not remember that I ever read any other poem by Ralph
Hodgson.
I do remember that Leonardo da Vinci used to buy such
birds, however, in Florence, and then let them out of their
cages.
And that Helen of Troy did have at least one daughter,
named Hermione.
And that Leonardo also thought up a method to prevent the
Arno from overflowing its banks, to which nobody obviously
paid any attention.
For that matter Leonardo at least once put snow into one of
his paintings too, even if I cannot remember whether Andrea
del Sart° or Taddeo Gaddi ever did.
In addition to which, Rembrandt's pupils used to paint gold
coins on the floor of his studio and make them look so real that
Rembrandt would stoop to pick them up, although I am un-
certain as to why this reminds me of Robert Rauschenberg
again.
