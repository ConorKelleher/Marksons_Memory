I have always harbored sincere doubts that Helen was the
cause of that war, by the way.
A single Spartan girl, after all.
As a matter of fact the whole thing was undeniably a mercan-
tile proposition. All ten years of it, just to see who would pay
tariff to whom, so as to be able to make use of a channel of water.
A . different poet, named Rupert Brooke, died in the Dar-
danelles during the first World War, even if! do not believe that
I remembered this when I visited the Dardanelles, by which I
mean the Hellespont.
Still, I find it extraordinary that young men died there in a
war that long ago, and then died in the same place three
thousand years after that.
And on second thought the gold coins that Rembrandt's
pupils painted on the floor of his studio are exactly what I was
talking about when I was talking about Robert Rauschenberg.
Or rather what I was talking about when I was talking about
the person who is not at the window in the painting of this
house.
The coins having only been coins until Rembrandt bent over.
Which did not deter me from rigging up a generator and
floodlights in the Colosseum, however.
Or from being shrewd enough to call the cat Calpurnia, after
having gotten no response with Nero and Caligula.
Still, if Rembrandt had had a cat, it would have strolled right
past the coins without so much as a glance.
Which does not imply that Rembrandt's cat was more intel-
ligent than Rembrandt.
Even if it so happens that Rembrandt kept on doing that,
incidentally, no matter how many times they tricked him.
The world being full of stories about pupils playing tricks on
their teachers, of course.
Leonardo once played a trick on Verrocchio by filling in part
of a canvas so beautifully that Verrocchio decided to go into
another line of work.
