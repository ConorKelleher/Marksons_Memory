One finds it difficult to think of Aristotle playing tricks on
Plato, on the other hand.
Or even to think of Aristotle doing lessons.
One can easily manage to visualize Helen doing them,
however. One can even see her chewing on a pencil.
Assuming the Greeks had had pencils, that would be.
As a matter of fact even Archimedes sometimes did his
geometry by writing in the sand. With a stick.
I accept the fact that it is doubtless not the same stick.
Even if it could well have drifted for years. Over and back
any number of times, in fact.
Helen left Hermione at home when she deserted Menelaus
and ran off with Paris, which is the one thing Helen did that one
wishes she hadn't.
Though it is not impossible that the ancient writers are not to
be fully trusted in regard to such topics, having been mostly
men.
What one really wishes is that Sappho had written some
plays.
Though in fact there are other versions anyhow.
Such as in the painting by Tiepolo, for instance, where Helen
is shown being carried off by force.
The Rape of Helen, in fact, being what Tiepolo called the
painting.
Medea is a little harder to visualize chewing on a pencil.
Perhaps at seven or eight. After that she would have been
Germaine Greer.
For the life of me I cannot remember when the last time I
thought about Germaine Greer was. Possibly there are some
books by her in this house, however.
Though I still cannot imagine what that other tide might
mean, about grass no longer being real.
Perhaps my stick was once a baseball bat.
Perhaps Rembrandt's pupils once played baseball.
Cassandra was raped too, of course, after Troy fell.
