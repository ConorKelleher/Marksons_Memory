Doubtless there is no way of verifying that El Greco was
descended from Hermione, however, after practically three
thousand years.
Near the end of his life, Titian manipulated his pigments as
much with his fingers as with a brush, which was surely not the
way Giovanni Bellini taught him.
Naturally I had no way of knowing if the cat at the Colosseum
had nibbled at anything behind my back, since most of the cans
had seemed less than full to begin with.
Doubtless Brahms was once a pupil, also.
Even if, when he was only twelve, he was already playing the
• piano in a dance hall, which was more likely a house of prosti-
tution.
In fact Brahms went to prostitutes for the rest of his life.
Nonetheless it is still not impossible to visualize Brahms •
doing scales.
Well, and perhaps the prostitutes when he was still only
twelve were dancing girls after all.
Such as Jane Avril, for instance.
I have no idea if Brahms ever visited in Paris while Jane Avril
was dancing there.
Still, for some reason it strikes me as agreeable to think of
Brahms as having had an affair with Jane Avril.
Or at least with Cleopatre or Gazelle or Mlle. Eglantine, who
were some of the other dancers in Paris at that time.
How one remembers certain things is beyond me.
Perhaps Guy de Maupassant was rowing, when Brahms
visited in Paris.
Once, Bertrand Russell took his pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein
to watch Alfred North Whitehead row, at Cambridge. Wittgen-
stein became very angry with Bertrand Russell for having
wasted his day.
In addition to remembering things that one does not know
how one remembers, one would also appear to remember things
that one has no idea how one knew to begin with. •
