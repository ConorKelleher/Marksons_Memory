Although perhaps Toulouse-Lautrec once handled my stick,
even if Archimedes did not, having walked with a cane.
Then again, one of the popes made people burn most of what
Sappho did write.
Doubtless my ankle was only sprained. Though it was
swollen to twice its normal size.
Could that person T. E. Shaw have been a baseball player,
perhaps?
And what have I been saying that has now made me think
about Achilles again?
Now is perhaps not the correct word in any case.
By which I mean that I was undeniably thinking about
Achilles at the moment when I started to type that sentence, but
was no longer thinking about him by the time I had finished it.
One allows one's self to finish such sentences, of course.
Even if by the time one has managed to indicate that one is
thinking about one thing, one has actually begun thinking about
another.
What happened after I started to write about Achilles was
that halfway through the sentence I began to think about a cat,
instead.
The cat I began to think about instead was the cat outside of
the broken window in the room next to this one, at which the
tape frequently scratches when there is a breeze.
Which is to say that I was not actually thinking about a cat
either, there being no cat except insofar as the sound of the
scratching reminds me of one.
As there were no coins on the floor of Rembrandt's studio,
except insofar as the configuration of the pigment reminded
Rembrandt of them.
As there was, or is, no person at the window in the painting of
this house.
As for that matter there is not even a house in the painting of
this house, should one wish to carry the matter that far.
Certain matters would appear to get carried certain distances
