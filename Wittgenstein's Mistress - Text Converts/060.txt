whether one wishes them to or not, unfortunately.
Although perhaps this is the very subject of that other book,
come to think about it. Quite possibly what I have taken to be a
book about baseball is actually some sort of scholarly specula-
tion about there having been no grass where people played
baseball except insofar as the people playing baseball believed
that there was.
At first glance one would scarcely have expected Wuthering
Heights to be a book about windows, either.
Though it remains a fact that there was once some very real
grass that had been mowed at the side of this house.
As can be readily verified by a glance at that same painting.
Though I am very likely now contradicting myself.
In either case the tape has now stopped scratching.
Nor am I thinking about a cat any longer.
Then again I certainly would have had to be thinking about
one while I was typing that sentence, even though the sentence
says just the opposite.
Surely one cannot type a sentence saying that one is not
thinking about something without thinking about the very thing
that one says one is not thinking about.
I believe I have only now noted this. Or something very much
like this.
Possibly I should drop the subject.
Actually, all I had been thinking about in regard to Achilles
was his heel.
Although I do not have any sort of limp, if I have possibly
given that impression.
And meanwhile I am also now curious about the tape itself,
since for the life of me I cannot remember having put it ,up.
Unquestionably I did put it up, however, since I can
remember very distinctly when the window broke.
Oh, dear, the wind has just broken one of the windows in one
of the rooms downstairs, I can even remember thinking.
This would have been right after I had heard the glass, naturally.
