[64]
And on a windy night.
Yet for the life of me I cannot remember repairing that
window.
In fact I am next to positive that I have never had any tape in
this house.
The last time I can remember having seen any tape, any-
where, was on the afternoon when I drove the Volkswagen van
full of first aid items into the Mediterranean.
As it happened there was a tape deck in the van also,
although this is of course in no way connected to the sort of tape
I am talking about.
The tape deck in the van was playing The Seasons, by
Vivaldi.
Even after I had climbed back up the embankment, the tape
deck continued to play. In my upside down car that was filling
up with the sea.
As a matter of fact what it was playing was Les Troyens, by
Berlioz.
This held a particular interest for me, in fact, what with my
having been in Hisarlik not long before. For some time I sat on
the embankment and listened to it.
Though to tell the truth I had much more recently been in
Rome. And in Rimini and Perugia and Venice.
So that perhaps the tape deck was playing something else
entirely.
For the life of me I cannot remember what I had been trying
to get that monstrosity of a canvas up that stairway for.
Even if the question was soon enough rendered irrelevant,
considering the manner in which I did not get it up.
And what have I been saying that has now made me think
about Braluns's mother?
In this instance I can make an educated guess, since the poor
woman had a crippled leg.
For the life of me I would not have believed that the life of
Brahms was the book I had read in this house.
