Evidently not every question falls into the category of
questions that would appear to remain unanswerable, however.
Though what must now surprise me is that I would have
troubled to read a book so badly damaged, or printed on such
cheap paper.
Any number of books in this house are in considerably better
condition, even if all of them show evidence of dampness.
Such as the atlas, for instance. Although the atlas has had the
advantage of lying flat, generally, rather than standing askew.
In fact I returned it to that same position not two days ago,
after having wished to remind myself where Lititz, Pennsylvania,
and Ithaca, New York, might be.
The book about baseball has a green cover, incidentally,
which is possibly appropriate.
Conversely there does not appear to be a single book about
art in this house.
My reason for remarking on this is not personal. Rather I find
it unusual simply because of another painter once seeming to
have lived here.
Then again the other painter may have only been a guest. In
• which case the painting of the house may well have been done
as a sort of gift, in return for her visit.
Though in suggesting that, I am of course forgetting the
several other paintings in certain of the rooms here that I do not
go into, and to which the doors are closed.
Possibly those other paintings are paintings by the same
painter, as well.
In fact I am certain that they are, in spite of my not having
looked at any of them since closing the doors, which I did some
time ago.
The only one of the closed doors which I any longer open is
the one to the room where the atlas and the life of Brahms are,
and that has been happening only lately.
It is scarcely a demanding proposition to determine that all
three paintings on the walls of the same house have been
