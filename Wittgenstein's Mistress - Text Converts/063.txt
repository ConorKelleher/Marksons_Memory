painted by the same painter, however.
More especially when all three are paintings of houses at, or
near, a beach, as I have now remembered that the other two are
also.
Though I naturally possess more practiced equipment for
making such a determination, should that become necessary.
In either event, what now occurs to me is that the painter was
doubtless not a guest in this house either, but more likely was
somebody who lived nearby. Which would more readily
explain why there are three paintings by her in a house in which
there are an inordinate number of books but not one of those
books is about art.
Being so closely familiar with the painter's subject matter,
the people who did live in this house would have presumably
been delighted to display such paintings.
No question of aesthetic understanding would have had to
enter into the arrangement at all.
For that matter perhaps all of the houses along this beach, or
many of them, contain other examples of the same painter's
work.
Perhaps even the very house which I burned to the ground
contained such examples, even though it would obviously not
contain them any longer, no longer being a house.
Well, it is still a house.
Even if there is not remarkably much left of it,! am still prone
to think of it as a house when I pass it in taking my walks.
There is the house that I burned to the ground, I might think.
Or, soon I will be coming to the house that I burned to the
ground.
None of the three paintings in this house is signed, incidentally.
Actually, I do not remember looking, but I am positive that
looking is something I would have done.
Even in museums, it is something I often do.
I have even done it with paintings that I have been familiar
with for years.
