I hardly do it because I believe that there might be any error
in the attribution of a painting.
In fact! have no idea why I do it.
Frequently, Modigliani would sign the work of other
painters. This was so they would be able to sell paintings that
they otherwise might not have sold.
Doubtless I should not have said frequently. Doubtless
Modigliani did this only a handful of times.
Still, it was kind of Modigliani, since a certain number of his
Mends were not eating very well.
In fact Modigliani himself often did not eat well, although
basically this would have been because he was drinking,
instead.
Once, in the Borghese Gallery, in Rome, I signed a mirror.
I did that in one of the women's rooms, with a lipstick.
What I was signing was an image of myself, naturally.
Should anybody else have looked, where my signature would
have been was under the other person's image, however.
Doubtless I would not have signed it, had there been
anybody else to look.
Though in fact the name I put down was Giotto.
There is only one mirror in this house, incidentally.
What that mirror reflects is also an image of myself, of
course.
Though in fact what it has also reflected now and again is an
image of my mother.
What will happen is that I will glance into the mirror and for
an instant I will see my mother looking back at me.
Naturally! will see myself during that same instant, as well.
In other words all that! am really seeing is my mother's
image in my own.
I am assuming that such an illusion is quite ordinary, and
comes with age.
Which is to say that it is not even an illusion, heredity being
heredity.
