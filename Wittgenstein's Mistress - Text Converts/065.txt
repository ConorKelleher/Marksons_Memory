Still, it is the sort of thing that can give one pause.
Even if it has also entered my mind to realize that I may be
almost as old, by now, as my mother was then.
My mother was only fifty-eight.
Though she was exactly fifty, when I painted her portrait.
Well, it was that birthday for which I painted it.
Though I rarely did portraits.
There were times when I regretted that I had never done a
portrait of Simon, however.
Other times I did not believe I would have wished to possess
such a reminder.
And perhaps it was their anniversary that I painted my
mother and father's portraits for.
In fact it was their thirtieth anniversary.
I painted both of the portraits from slides, meaning the gift to
be a surprise.
What this made it necessary to do was to hang dropcloths in
my studio, so as to contrive a dark corner in which I could make
use of the projector.
Generally I seemed to spend more time walking in and out of
the darkness, than actually pthnting.
To tell the truth, what I generally spent the greatest amount
of time doing was sitting, whenever I painted.
At times one can sit endlessly, before getting up to add a
single brushstroke to a canvas.
Leonardo was known to walk halfway across Milan to do
that, with The Last Supper, even when anybody else would
have believed it was finished.
Which did not keep The Last Supper from beginning to
deteriorate in Leonardo's own lifetime, however, because of a
foolish experiment he had tried, with oil tempera on the plaster.
In a manner of speaking, one could even say that The Last
Supper was already deteriorating while it was still being
painted.
For some reason the thought of this has always saddened me.
