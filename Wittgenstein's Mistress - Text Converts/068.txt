[71]
I had gone, since one would have surely had to row all the way
beyond the horizon itself.
For that matter one might have actually been able to row as
far as to where one was out of sight of the flames altogether, and
yet still have been seeing the glow against the clouds.
Which is to say that one would have then been seeing the fire
upside down, so to speak.
And not even the fire, but only an image of the fire.
Possibly there were no clouds, however.
And in either case I no longer had a rowboat.
Now, each time I go to the beach, I take a look to make
certain that the new rowboat is in its place.
In fact I took such a look only moments ago, when I came
back from the town.
Perhaps I have not mentioned that I came back from the town
by way of the beach, instead of the way I had gone, which was
by way of the road.
Which would explain why I did not remember to bring in my
pitcher, which I had left at the spring.
Frequently I tend to think of my jar as a pitcher. Doubtless
this is only because a pitcher has more of the sound of what one
would wish to carry to a spring.
Though perhaps another reason why I did not remember it is
that I am feeling somewhat tired.
Actually, I am not feeling tired. How I am feeling is not quite
myself.
Well, perhaps what I am more truthfully feeling is a kind of
depression. The whole thing is fairly abstract, at this point.
In any case, doubtless I was already feeling this way when I
stopped typing. Doubtless my decision to stop typing had much
to do with my feeling this way.
I have already forgotten what I had been typing when I began
to feel this way.
Obviously, I could look back. Surely that part cannot be very
many lines behind the line I am typing at this moment.
