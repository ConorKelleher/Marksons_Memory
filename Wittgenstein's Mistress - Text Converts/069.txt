On second thought I will not look back. If there was some-
thing I was typing that had contributed to my feeling this way,
doubtless it would contribute to it all over again.
I do not feel this way often, as a matter of fact.
Generally I feel quite well, considering.
Still, this other can happen.
It will pass. In the meantime there is little that one can do
about it.
Anxiety being the fundamental mood of existence, as
somebody once said, or unquestionably should have said.
Though to tell the truth I would have believed I had shed
most of such feelings, as long ago as when I shed most of my
other sort of baggage.
When winter is here, it will be here.
Even if one would appear never to be shed of the baggage in
one's head, on the other hand.
Such as the birthdays of people like Pablo Picasso or Dylan
Thomas, for instance, which I am convinced that I might still
recite if I wished.
Or the name Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, even if one still has
no idea who she may have been.
I do not know who Marina Tsvetayeva may have been either,
although in this case the name at least did not come into my
mind until an hour ago, when I was at the boat basin.
Obviously, I was thinking about the other sort of marina.
Actually it was Helen Frankenthaler's name that caught my
eye on that poster not far from the Via Vittorio Veneto. I do not
remember ever having been in a show with Georgia O'Keeffe.
Though in fact perhaps it was Kierkegaard who said that,
about anxiety being the fundamental mood of existence.
If it was not Kierkegaard it was Martin Heidegger.
In either case I suspect there is something ironical in my
being able to guess that something was said by Kierkegaard, or
by Martin Heidegger, when I am convinced that I have never
read a single word written by Kierkegaard or Martin Heidegger.
