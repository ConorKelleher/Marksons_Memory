A good deal of one's baggage would appear to be not even
one's own, as I have perhaps elsewhere suggested.
Anna Akhmatova is somebody else whom I have never read,
although doubtless she is in some way connected to Marina
Tsvetayeva.
Then again it is not impossible that there are books by all of
these people in this house.
I have noticed guides to several of the National Parks. As
well as one to the birds of the southern Aegean and the
Cyclades Islands.
There is an explanation for the atlas generally lying fiat,
incidentally, instead of standing askew.
The explanation being simply that the atlas is too tall for the
shelves.
And in either event I have just now categorically determined
where it was that I read the life of Brahms.
Where I read the life of Brahms was in London, in a book-
store near Hampstead Heath, on the morning when I was
almost hit by the car.
I believe I have mentioned being almost hit by the car, which
came rolling down a hill.
Perhaps I was not almost hit by the car. Still, one moment I
was reading the life of Brahms, and a moment after that,
whoosh! there went the frightening thing right past me.
Just imagine how this startled me, and how I felt.
Only a day before, I had sat in a vehicle with a right-hand
drive and watched a street called Maiden Lane, near Covent
Garden, fill up with snow, which must surely be rare.
Naturally the car that came down the hill had a right-hand
drive also, this still being London.
My reason for emphasizing this is simply because that same
side of the car was the side that was nearest me, and naturally
my first reaction was to look for who in heaven's name could be
driving.
Naturally nobody was driving.
