[74]
Still, my condition of being startled continued for quite some
time.
Unquestionably it was still continuing while I was realizing
that what the car was going to do next was to crash into the car I
had been driving myself, and which I had double parked a
certain distance farther down the hill.
Instead it crashed into something else altogether.
As a matter of fact it did not crash into anything at all, that I
saw, but kept right on down the hill and out of sight.
I.
All I am assuming when I say it crashed into something else
is that surely there would have had to be other obstacles in its ;
path sooner or later.
Certainly it would have had to hit a street sign, or possibly
even an English house, if it did not hit another car.
When one comes right down to it, on the other hand, I did not
hear the sound of the crash either.
Then again it is quite possible that I was not really listening,
what with the overall duration of that condition of being
startled.
All that I was truthfully doing was continuing to stand in front
of the bookstore, which was next door to a Mexican restaurant.
The restaurant had reproductions of paintings by David
Alfaro Siqueiros in its window.
The car in question had been a London taxi cab, by the way.
To this day I have no idea what may have caused it to roll
down that hill on a morning when I happened to be visiting in
the same neighborhood.
Something had finally deteriorated, doubtless, that it had
been wedged against.
Doubtless any number of other vehicles have been rolling
down any number of other hills, in fact, through all of these
years.
Quite possibly a certain number of them are doing exactly
that at this very moment, even.
One has no idea what number, but a certain number, surely.
