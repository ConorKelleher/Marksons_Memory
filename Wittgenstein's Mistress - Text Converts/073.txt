[76]
tionally, the chapter on Brahms could not have been more than
six pages long.
Unquestionably there would have been nothing about
dancing girls in it either.
Still, if I had not decided to read the chapter, certainly I
would have been somewhere else by the time the taxi rolled
down the hill.
Instead, there I was, forced to think, good heavens! here
comes a car, and a moment after that, oh, well, of course it is not
a car.
In thinking the latter I meant only that it was not a car with
anybody driving it, obviously.
Naturally you can never find a taxi when you want one.
But again, all of this in the midst of all that looking, none-
theless.
Not to speak of all that anxiety.
Although as a matter of fact I noticed a taxi just today, at the
boat basin.
That particular taxi has been in the identical spot since I
came to this beach, however.
Nor will it leave, what with all four of the tires being flat in
this case.
In fact its wheels are in deep sand, also.
The tires on the pickup truck are fine. Though naturally I
check those.
There is an air pump under the seat, in any event.
Then again I suspect that I may have neglected to run the
battery for some time, now.
I have just walked out to the pickup truck.
Actually where I walked was to the spring, which the truck is
next to. I went for the pitcher, which is how I think of the jar.
Before bringing it back I emptied it out and filled it again,
since the water had already turned warm from standing in the
sun.
The water at the spring itself is always cool, however. /
