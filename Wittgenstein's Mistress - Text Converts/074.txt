I have brought in lilacs, also.
It is Joan Baez, I believe, whom I would like to inform that
one can now kneel and drink from the Loire, or the Po, or the
Mississippi.
Winters, when the snows come and the trees write their
strange calligraphy against the whiteness, sometimes the only
other demarcation is that of my path to the spring.
Well, and in the opposite direction too, of the path that I
follow through the dunes to the beach.
Although I am completely forgetting the third path, just in
back of the dunes, which is still another that can be seen at such
times.
That third path is the path to the house that I have been
dismantling.
Perhaps I have not mentioned that I am dismantling a house.
I am dismantling a house.
It is tedious work, but necessary.
I do not make a major project out of it, on the other hand.
Basically I treat it in much the same way as I treat the question
of my driftwood.
Perhaps I have not mentioned how I treat the question of my
driftwood.
All that will happen, basically, is that now and again I will be
walking past the house, and a board will catch my eye, and so I
will dismantle the board and carry it home.
Assuming I am not already carrying driftwood, obviously.
Actually there was adequate firewood here already, for my
first winter.
Well, there was almost adequate firewood here. Later along I
burned certain items of furniture.
All of those were from the rooms that! no longer make use of,
as it happens, and to which the doors are closed.
Now that! think about it, very possibly that is even why I
have taken to closing those doors, although I cannot imagine
why I would not have made this connection before.
