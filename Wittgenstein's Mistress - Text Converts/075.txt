[78]
In any case the house that I am dismantling contains almost
no furniture at all. In fact it is quite indifferently built.
The only tool I have needed for any of the work is a crowbar,
which I took from beneath the same seat in the pickup truck.
Well, there is also the saw, which I came upon in the house
