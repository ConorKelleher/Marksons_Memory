of six pages in a history of music that was written for children,
and had been printed in extraordinarily large type, can truly be
considered as the reading of a life of Brahms?
Or did I also read certain additional pages in the more
genuine life of Brahms, such as certain pages about dancing
girls, when I was setting fire to those pages in trying to simulate
a seagull?
Not knowing that there was a second copy of the identical
book, with all of the pages still in it, still here in the house?
Doubtless these are inconsequential perplexities. Still,
inconsequential perplexities have now and again been known to
become the fundamental mood of existence, one suspects.
The world is everything that is the case.
Hm.
But I have just made one more connection that I had never
thought about before either.
Will the house that I am dismantling become the second
house on this beach that I have burned to the ground?
Granting that I am burning that house board by board, and
that it will be quite some time before I have dismantled it fully
enough to be able to consider it as having been burned to the
ground, nonetheless the fact that I am doing exactly that would
appear to be indisputable.
One day that house, too, will look as if Robert Rauschenberg
had gotten to it.
There is the house that I dismantled board by board and
erased to the ground, I will think in walking past.
Doubtless by then I will also be erasing another house.
Naturally I have been leaving out such things as stone
chimneys when I have spoken about houses as still being
houses even when they are no longer houses, by the way.
Well, and plumbing.
As a matter of fact one can still see a toilet fastened to pipes
on the second floor of the house in which I knocked over the
kerosene lamp.
