Even if there is no longer a second floor.
There is the toilet on the second floor of the house that I
burned to the ground, is what I will more truly think, in walking
past. Or, soon I will be coming to the toilet on the second floor
of the house that I burned to the ground.
In SoHo, back at the beginning, I now remember that I used
to empty bottled water into the tank, so as to still be able to
flush.
Any number of habits died hard, that way. For some period I
continued carrying my driver's license and other identification,
similarly.
Naturally I will have stopped taking the path to the beach
once it has become genuinely snowy here, on the other hand.
Which is to say that I sometimes still do make use of a bath-
room after all, even if in this case it is by having taken up a
board from the bathroom floor.
Perhaps I have not mentioned having taken up a board from
the bathroom floor.
I have taken up a board from the bathroom floor.
In a manner of speaking, doubtless it might be said that I am
dismantling this house, too.
Although I have scarcely burned that particular board, which
is in fact normally back in the identical place from which I have
taken it.
As often as it has appeared necessary, I have shoveled away
part of the embankment just outside.
Doubtless I had established some sort of similar hygienic
arrangement in the house that I burned to the ground on the
night that my rowboat disappeared, as well.
In fact my rowboat did not disappear on the night that I
burned that house to the ground.
It was on that night that I happened to become aware of the
rowboat's disappearance, which is something else altogether. ii
Very possibly the rowboat had already been gone for days,
since I had scarcely yet taken to looking out for it as I do now.
