I will not trouble to point out again how one's language is
frequently imprecise in such ways.
One morning I was similarly convinced that all seventeen of
my watches had disappeared too, now that I think about it.
What happened was that I woke up in a car beside the Pont
Neuf, in Paris, and understood that I had not heard the alarms.
Why have I been awakened by the sun coming in through my
windshield, I wondered, instead of by my seventeen simulta-
neous buzzings?
It was some moments before I remembered that I had
divested myself of the watches on a different bridge altogether,
some while before, I believe in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
Although I find it interesting that I can almost always make a
distinction between periods when I was mad and periods when I
was not, when one comes down to it.
Such as when I read certain books out loud, as I did with
Aeschylus and Euripides when I was living in the Louvre,
which was always a conclusive sign.
The Louvre is practically right beside the Pont Neuf, by the
way.
The reverse of that statement being equally true, obviously.
In either case doubtless I was not yet living in the Louvre on
the morning when I woke up in the car practically right beside it.
Surely I would have had no reason to sleep in a car if I had
already taken to burning artifacts and picture frames in the
museum itself, which I unquestionably eventually did.
Well, such as the frame from La Gioconda by Leonardo, for
instance, from which the old varnish gave the smoke an
astringent odor.
Although the sun actually woke me in cars far more times
than that once, to tell the truth.
Frequently I watched the sun setting from cars, as well.
The latter was especially true in Russia, of course, where I
kept on driving into the west for day after day after day.
Almost every one of the books I read about ancient Troy was
