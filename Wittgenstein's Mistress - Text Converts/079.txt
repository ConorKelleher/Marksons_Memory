a book that I read out loud, come to think about it.
For some reason, a part I always liked was Odysseus pre-
tending he was mad himself, so that they would not make him
go to fight.
How he pretended this was by sowing salt into the ground,
while he was plowing.
Somebody very shrewdly put Odysseus's little boy into one
of the furrows, however, and naturally he did not plow his little
boy.
Tiepolo painted this also, I believe. The Madness of Ulysses,
being what he called it.
In fact I am quite certain that the painting is in the same
museum with The Rape of Helen, even if I cannot remember
which museum that is.
Possibly I should point out that Odysseus and Ulysses were
the same person. For some reason the Romans changed his
name.
Well, doubtless they did this for the identical reason that the
Spaniards changed El Greco's name. Even if Odysseus seems
hardly as difficult to pronounce as Domenikos Theotocopoulos.
La Gioconda is another name for the Mona Lisa, of course.
In the Odyssey, while he is waiting for Ulysses to come
home, the same little boy goes to visit Helen and Menelaus, in
Sparta, and Helen has a splendid radiant dignity.
Then again the little boy is hardly so little by then, it having
been ten years for the war and still another ten with Odysseus
being a tourist.
This is the same twenty years during which Penelope is said
to have spent her time weaving, naturally, if one wishes to
believe that.
I doubt that I believe one word of it, myself.
Penelope and Helen were cousins, incidentally.
The things one knows.
Well, this making her Clytemnestra's cousin too, of course,
Helen and Clytemnestra having been sisters.
