Although what I am now thinking about is the scene in which
Odysseus has himself lashed to the mast of his ship, so that he
can listen to the Sirens singing but will stay put
For some reason this story reminds me of something, even
though I cannot remember what it reminds me of.
Telemachus is the little boy's name, by the way. Although I
believe I mentioned this a good many pages ago.
The name of the friend for whom Achilles weeps is Patroclus,
which on the other hand I am quite certain I did leave out.
My last lover was named Lucien. I find it interesting that I
have not included the name of a single one of my lovers in any of
these pages, either.
Possibly those paintings by Tiepolo are in the Hermitage, at
which I spent several days before leaving for home across
Russia in the opposite direction.
As a matter of fact they are in Milan, where I saw them on the
very day when I was so saddened by The Last Supper.
Where I watched the sunsets on that return trip, naturally,
was more often than not in my rearview mirror.
Which would have made them images of sunsets rather than
sunsets, come to think about it. And with the left side being the
right, or vice versa, although one was doubtless less conscious
of this with sunsets than one would have been with Michel-
angelo's notebooks.
Doubtless I was much more interested in keeping a weather
eye out for Anna Karenina in either case, since I was naturally
still looking, at the time.
Have I mentioned looking in Amsterdam, New York, or in
Syracuse, or in Toledo, Ohio?
Meanwhile I have no idea why rearview mirrors should
remind me that I was feeling a certain depression, yesterday.
In fact I have perhaps omitted to indicate that that was
yesterday.
Last evening's sunset had a certain stillness about it, as if
Piero della Francesca had done the color.
