[84]
What I woke up to this morning were the lilacs, breathing
them all over the house.
Later, I washed myself with some of the water I had brought
in from the spring.
I am still wearing the underpants I wore yesterday, however.
This is because even though I went to the spring twice, on
both trips I walked right past my laundry, which is spread
across bushes.
To tell the truth, I am still feeling a touch of that same depres-
sion, as well.
Possibly what I had been thinking about yesterday was the
tiny, pocket sort of mirror that had been beside my mother's
bed, although I do not remember having thought about that
yesterday.
There is a distinction to be made between this sort of depres-
sion and the depression I generally felt while I was still doing all
of that looking, by the way, the latter having been much more
decidedly a kind of anxiety.
Although I believe I have noted that.
One day I appeared to have finally stopped looking, in any
event.
At the intersection of Anna Akhmatova Street and Rodion
Romanovitch Raskolnikov Mews, perhaps this was.
Doubtless it would have been around that same time that I
stopped reading out loud, also. Or in any case surely tearing out
pages after having finished their reverse sides, so as to be able to
drop them into the fire.
What I did later, with the pages from the life of Braluns, was
to toss those into the breeze in the hope that the ash might take
flight.
In Cadiz, where he was once writing his poems while living
for a certain period near water, Marco Antonio Montes de Oca
had a seagull which came to his window each morning, to be fed.
It was Lucien, in fact, who told me that. Lucien was once
acquainted with William Gaddis also, I believe.
