Though perhaps it was William Gaddis who lived for a
certain period near water in Cadiz, and had a pet seagull.
The cat in the Colosseum was black, I am next to positive,
and held up one paw as if it had hurt itself.
Nothing that I am writing in these moments should cause me
to continue to feel depressed, I do not believe.
Although I am perhaps just enough disturbed by these under-
pants to have let that become a sort of nuisance factor.
I have just gone out for fresh underpants.
What I more exactly did was change while I was out there.
There is always something pleasurable about changing into
garments that are still warm from the sun.
Which will perhaps explain why I again left everything else
on the bushes, in fact.
Then again, some of it may well remain there indefinitely,
since I generally wear nothing at all, summers.
Once, I actually left out certain items which became frozen,
when an early frost surprised me.
By the time I remembered to go for them, I was able to stand
several of my wraparound denim skirts upright on the ground.
Skirt sculptures, one might have considered them.
And there can be no doubt at all that I had gotten rid of my
anxiety by then, since I was even able to be amused by the
concept.
Apparently, one day I had been looking and then one day I
was not, as I have said.
Although very likely it was hardly that simple either.
Doubtless I had not even realized that anything had changed,
for some time.
For some time I have been watching the sun go down every
evening without anxiety, is perhaps what I finally one evening
remembered to think.
Or, the eternal silence of these infinite spaces no longer
makes me feel like Pascal.
I doubt very seriously that I thought that.
