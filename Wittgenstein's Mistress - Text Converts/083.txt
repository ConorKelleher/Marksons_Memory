[86]
Sculpture is the art of taking away superfluous material,
Leonardo once said, if that is at all relevant?
Although it was not Leonardo who said it but was
Michelangelo.
And on third thought I believe that Leonardo did not put
snow into one of his paintings after all. Certain whitish rocks in
mist, were what I had had in mind.
Quite possibly Tiepolo did not paint either of those two
paintings either, now that I think about it, although in this
instance all I mean is that Tiepolo had a great many assistants
in his workshop, and so may have done no more than the pre-
liminary sketches.
Though as a matter of fact he also did, or did not, do a
painting of Agamemnon sacrificing poor Iphigenia to raise
winds for the Greek ships.
Painting is not my trade, is another thing that Michelangelo
once said. When he said this was when a pope told him that the
Sistine Chapel might look more agreeable with some pictures
up on top.
Perhaps this was the same pope who once offered Michel-
angelo his chair, out of respect. This was a very significant
moment in the history of art, since nothing of the sort had ever
happened with an artist before.
I serve him who pays me, is something that Leonardo did say
instead of Michelangelo, on the other hand. Doubtless there is a
way in which this moment had its significance in the history of
art, as well.
Actually, Tintoretto once threatened to shoot a critic with a
gun, which many artists would have perhaps felt was a more
significant moment than both of those put together.
And possibly it was only one of the Medici, who let Michel-
angelo sit down. Still, one would be pleased if the pope was not
the same pope who made people burn Sappho's poems.
When I state that any of these things were done or said,
incidentally, what I more truthfully mean is that they were
