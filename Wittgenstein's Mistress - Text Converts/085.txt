having been more than just dear friends.
In fact I have just even quoted Friedrich Nietzsche.
Actually, it was almost an hour ago when I quoted Friedrich
Nietzsche, who was really Pascal.
Where I have been was at the spring again. This time I
decided I may as well bring in everything.
Nor am I any longer depressed, incidentally, which I now
understand that I had not been to begin with, having only been
out of sorts.
Which is to say that I had changed into those fresh under-
pants perhaps fifteen minutes earlier than I ought to have,
having now had to change again, having just gotten my period.
I have no intention of looking back to see what I wrote about
inconsequential perplexities now and again becoming the
fundamental mood of existence. Or about certain unanswer-
able questions becoming answerable.
Oh, well.
At any rate everything that had been washed is now in my
upstairs bedroom.
For a moment or two, before I came back down, I looked out
of the rear window.
I do not often look out of that one, which is not the one from
which I watch the sun go down.
What I was looking at was the other house, which is deep in
the woods some distance from here.
I do not believe I have ever mentioned the other house.
What I may have mentioned are houses in general, along the
beach, but such a generalization would not have included this
house, this house being nowhere near the water.
All one can see of it from that upper rear window is a corner
of its roof.
In fact I was not aware of the other house at all, when I first
came to this one.
Once I did become aware of it, I understood that there would
also have to be a road leading to it from somewhere, of course.
