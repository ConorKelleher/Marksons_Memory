Yet for the life of me I was not able to locate the road, and for
the longest time.
Looking for it, what I did first was drive the pickup truck

mind.
Indeed, I had been just enough distracted by the entire
proposition so that the logic in this notion delighted me.
In fact what I additionally told myself was, as quickly as I get
