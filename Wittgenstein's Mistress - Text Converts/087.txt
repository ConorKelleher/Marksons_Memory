to the house I will next follow the road to wherever it comes out,
and thus will have eliminated any trace of the mystery altogether.
The road came out at the road one takes in the direction away
from the town.
Well, when I say came, obviously I mean comes, since to this
day the road naturally remains exactly where it had been all the
while.
The fallen tree naturally remains exactly where it had been
all the while, as well.
Good heavens. And how long had I permitted myself to fret
over not locating that road?
Surely I had driven past that fallen tree no less than six or
eight times.
And meanwhile no sooner had I solved the problem than I
understood that I no longer had any interest in the road what-
soever, of course.
Nor do I have very much interest in the house either, to tell
the truth.
Except as perhaps something to gaze at the corner of the roof
of, on certain occasions, as I just now did.
It is likely that I will now bleed for weeks, incidentally. Or at
least stain for that long.
This is a matter of hormones, doubtless, and of change of life.
My hands would appear to indicate that it is time for this.
Being a painter, one learns to read such things as the backs of
hands.
Even if I rarely did portraits.
That other house is quite ordinary, by the way.
Well, except for being the only house in the vicinity which
was constructed for people who preferred a view of the woods
to a view of the water, obviously.
I imagine I can understand such a preference. It is hardly my
own preference, but I imagine I can understand it.
Then again one would get little more than an inference of the
sunset at best, over there, even from the upper windows.
