Well, I have looked. Which is a thing one might do.
Although what I was more truthfully looking for was to see if
one could see my own house from there.
This is a thing one might do, as well.
One cannot see this house from that one.
Obviously, this is a result of nothing more than where
windows happen to be situated. Still, one could easily let it
become a perplexity of a sort too, should one be so inclined.
After all, why on earth should one be able to see one house
from another, but not vice versa? Surely there is no difference in
the distance between this house and that, and that house and
this?
Once, in the Rijksmuseum, I brought in new speakers for my
phonograph. What the directions told me to do was to make
certain that the two speakers were equidistant from each other.
One certainly had to wonder what the person who wrote the
instructions could have believed he meant by that.
Well, or the person who had translated the instructions from
the Japanese.
No matter where one situated them, how could there be any
way in which any two objects could be any distance from each
other except equidistant?
Even if there were some miraculous manner in which I were
able to move this house, for instance, surely it would still end up
being exactly the same distance from the other house that the
other house would be from this.
Although in that case this one might at least land where it
could finally be seen from the other after all.
As a matter of fact I actually once did see this house from that
one anyway, now that I think about it.
What happened was that there was a fire in my potbellied
stove, on an afternoon when I decided to take a walk through
the woods.
Looking back, I could see the smoke above the trees.
There is my house, being what I thought when I looked.
