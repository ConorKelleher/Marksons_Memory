I have noted the persistence of this sort of thinking before, I
believe.
Doubtless I would have expressed an identical thought on
the night when my earlier house was turning into little more
than an upside down glow on the clouds, in fact, had I had a
rowboat to express it in at the time.
Perhaps all such thoughts might very well fall into the same
category as the thought that there is somebody at a window in a

since I would appear to have verified that paintings are never

In fact it also lists all of the dancers' names, including hers.
The other names that the poster lists are Cleopatre and

Unfortunately there is no life of Brahms in the other house in
which I might have looked up more about this.
The life of Beethoven would have been of no help, one
presumed.
The title of the life of Beethoven in the other house is
