Beethoven, by the way.
The title of the life of Brahms that! did once look into, insofar
as I can remember, was A Life of Brahms.
Well, doubtless I could readily verify this, there being a
second copy of the life of Brahms still accessible right where I am.
Then again, what one is now perhaps forced to wonder is if
the title of the life of Brahms would remain A Life ofBrahms if
there did not happen to be that second copy still at hand.
If there were no more copies accessible anywhere of Anna
Karenina, in other words, would its title still be Anna
Karen ma?
I am perhaps less than certain what I mean by that question.
Still, it would undeniably appear that I have more than once
thought about a life of Brahms when I was not seeing a life of
Brahms.
For that matter! have more than once thought about The
Recognitions, by William Gaddis, when I have not seen a copy
of The Recognitions by William Gaddis in twelve or fifteen
years.
I have even thought about William Gaddis himself, when I
have not seen William Gaddis for twelve or fifteen years either.
In fact I may never have seen William Gaddis.
Moreover I have also thought about T. E. Shaw and I do not
even know who T. E. Shaw was.
Although having finally remembered that Marco Antonio
Montes de Oca wrote poetry, perhaps I can at least safely
assume that Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz did also.
But what I am actually now thinking about, for some reason,
is the scene in The Trojan Women where the Greek soldiers
throw Hector's poor baby boy over the city's walls, so that he
will not grow up to take revenge for his father or for Troy.
God, the things men used to do.
Irene Papas was an effective Helen in the film of The Trojan
Women, however.
Katharine Hepburn was an effective Hecuba, as well.
