There seemed no point whatsoever in mentioning any of this.
Even if it happens that Alexander the Great always kept a copy
of the Iliad right next to his bed, and actually believed that he
was directly descended from Achilles.
Or that Achilles once almost drowned in the Scamander.
Although I have also now remembered that Jane Avril kept a
certain book right next to her bed too, even if I have forgotten
what book.
And now I further remember that it was Odysseus, again,
who convinced the other Greeks that they should not leave any
male survivors at Troy.
God, the things men used to do.
I have just said that, I know.
Still, what especially distresses me, in this instance, is how
quickly Odysseus had forgotten that plow, and his own little boy.
At least one can be gratified that Sappho had a child of her
own, too. Well, a daughter, like Helen.
Which is to say that any number of later Greeks could have
been directly descended from Sappho as well, even if one would
have surely lost track, after a certain period of years.
But who is to argue that it might not have come all the way
down to somebody like Irene Papas, even?
Plato's own teacher was of course Socrates, if! have not said.
Meanwhile the title of that life of Brahms, I suddenly suspect,
may well have been The Life of Brahms, and not A Life of
Brahms after all.
Undeniably The Life of Brahms would have been more
appropriate, the man having had only one life.
Which is perhaps failing to consider the possibility of its
having been called simply Brahms, however.
Or that there also happens to be a life of Shostakovitch in the
other house, the title of which is Shostakovitch, A Biography.
There is no poster showing Jane Avril and three other Paris
dancers taped to the living room wall in the other house,
incidentally.
