Although come to think about it I once read somewhere that
Ludwig Wittgenstein himself had never read one word of
Aristotle.
In fact I have more than once taken comfort in knowing this,
there being so many people one has never read one word of
one's self.
Such as Ludwig Wittgenstein.
Even if one was always told that Wittgenstein was too hard
