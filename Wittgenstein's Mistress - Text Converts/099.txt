But all that I actually have in mind is all of that giveaway
silence again, which would surely appear to verify that Samuel
Butler was wrong about a woman having written the Odyssey.
How curious. Even when I had already begun typing that
sentence, I would have sworn I still had no idea who it was who
had made that suggestion.
So now I also remember that the translator who read
Shakespeare too many times was named Gilbert Murray.
Other than that I have no notion of who Samuel Butler was,
however, unless perhaps she was the same Samuel Butler who
wrote The Way of All Flesh.
Although all I know about The Way of All Flesh, in turn, is
that I would be pleased to hear that Ludwig Wittgenstein had
not read one word of it.
Gilbert Murray, I believe one can meanwhile assume, was
somebody who translated Greek plays.
When he was not reading Shakespeare.
Rubens painted a version of Achilles hiding among the
women also, by the way.
Too, there is a drawing by him of Achilles slaying Hector,
with a spear through the throat.
One of the things people generally admired about Rubens,
even if they were not always aware of it, was the way everybody
in his paintings is always touching everybody else.
Well, hardly including the way Achilles is touching Hector,
obviously.
Meantime I may have made an error, earlier, in saying that
where Rupert Brooke died during the first World War was at
the Hellespont, by which I mean the Dardanelles.
Where I believe he actually died was on the island of Scyros,
even though the latter is only a little bit south in the Aegean.
I bring this up only because Scyros was the same island on
which Achilles did all that hiding.
Again, however, I am by no means implying that there is any /
significance in such connections.
