Even if the child born to the woman on Scyros who Achilles
made pregnant grew up to become the very soldier who threw
Hector's little boy over the walls.
And after that became the husband of Helen's daughter
Hermione.
Which in either case still leaves me in the dark as to how I
know about Samuel Butler.
Although doubtless I read about him in a footnote, in one of
the books about the Greeks I did pay attention to.
At any rate I unquestionably paid enough attention to be
certain that Achilles's son would have been far too young to be
at Troy when he was supposed to. And that Hermione would
have been practically old enough to be his mother.
Then again I almost never read footnotes.
Though once I did read a lovely poem by Rupert Brooke,
about Helen growing older.
Actually, the poem made her a nag.
Besides Briseis, the name of another mistress I remember is
Jeanne Hebuterne, who had a child by Modigliani. Although
that particular story is one of the saddest I know.
What happened was that Jeanne Hebuterne threw herself out
of a window, on the morning after Modigliani died.
While again being pregnant.
The things women used to do, too, one is almost tempted to
add.
What do any of us ever truly know, however?
And at least the word mistress had finally gone out of style.
Meanwhile, Samuel Butler, the author of The Way of All
Flesh, has suggested that the Odyssey was written by a woman,
I am assuming the footnote said.
Although doubtless there was rather more to it than that, it
being a fairly safe guess that one does not change Homer from a
man to a woman after three thousand years without including
some sort of interesting explanation.
I have no idea what that explanation may have been, however.
