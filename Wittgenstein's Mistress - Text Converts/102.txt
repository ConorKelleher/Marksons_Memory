which is another opera that Maria Callas frequently sang.
Although now and again I have mixed up Vincenzo Bellini
with Giovanni Bellini in turn, even if Giovanni Bellini is one of
the painters I have always most deeply admired.
Well, even Albrecht Diirer, whom I admire to almost the
same degree, once said that Bellini was still the best painter
alive.
I say still, since Diirer happened to be visiting in Venice at a
;
time when Bellini was quite old.
On the other hand this would have been before Diirer himself
became practically as mad as Piero di Cosimo, presumably. Or
as Hugo van der Goes.
Well, or as Friedrich Nietzsche, for all that I was once
extremely fond of one of Friedrich Nietzsche's sentences too.
As a matter of fact still another person I was once fond of a
sentence by, meaning Pascal, could doubtless be added to this
same list, what with refusing to sit on a chair without an addi-

In fact I now have to wonder if I did not mix up those two
sentences as well, and that it was Pascal who wrote the one
about wandering through an endless nothingness.

Pascal, but of Friedrich Nietzsche as Friedrich Nietzsche,

basically the same as that of the two dots over Bronte, however.
In either case, that remark about Giovanni Bellini would
have naturally also had to have been made before Diirer died
from a fever he caught in a Dutch swamp, where he had gone to
look at a stranded whale.
Although doubtless it was conversely made long after Bellini
himself had become Andrea Mantegna's brother-in-law.
I am now perhaps showing off.
