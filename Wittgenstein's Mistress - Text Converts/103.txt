postcards near a town called Savona, which is some distance
from Florence although also in Italy.
I had not noticed the tape deck in the van either, as it
happened, since it had not been playing while I was driving.
Only when the van went over an embankment and turned up-
side down in the Mediterranean did the tape deck begin to play.
I was not able to think of any explanation for why it did that.
Neither can I think of one now.
As a matter of fact the tape deck did not begin to play as soon
as the van turned upside down either.
Actually I had already gotten out and was standing in the
Mediterranean up to my waist before it started.
What I was doing was trying to get some of the dirt out of my
hair, from where the rubber mat from the floor had fallen on top
of me.
While I was doing that, I understood that my shoulder had
gotten hurt.
Doubtless it was not until I became convinced that my
shoulder had not gotten hurt badly, in fact, that I began to hear
Maria Callas.
Which is to say that perhaps she had been singing before that
after all.
Good heavens, here I have been driving a car which is now
upside down in the Mediterranean and I am hardly injured at
all, I was thinking, which is assuredly something else that would
have kept me from hearing her more quickly.
In addition to which I was doubtless distressed over how wet
I had gotten.
Perhaps I have not mentioned how wet I had gotten.
Well, doubtless I merely assumed it was unnecessary to
mention that, already having mentioned being up to my bottom
in the Mediterranean.
Too, I have never been on my hands and knees on the inside
of the roof of a car before, being doubtless one more thing that I
was thinking.
