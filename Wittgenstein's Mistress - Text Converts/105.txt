Borghese Gallery, in Rome, incidentally.
Although some few happened to be of the Via Vittorio
Veneto, which is almost directly below the Borghese Gallery.
The reverse of that statement being equally true, obviously.
Modigliani was only thirty-five, by the way.
Now that I think about it, I may have worn that soccer shirt
all the way to Paris, even.
Doubtless I stopped sitting on the other shirts after the rest of
my own garments dried, however.
As a matter of fact I waited for them to become partly dry
