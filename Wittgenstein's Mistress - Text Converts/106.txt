Petersburg without knowing it was St. Petersburg.
For that matter I myself had once wished to stop at Corinth,
in Greece, but only some time later discovered that I had
already been through Corinth and gone.
This was on a morning when I was driving counterclockwise,
among mountains, from Athens toward Sparta, as it happens.
Which is to say that it was on the very morning after I had
believed that somebody had called my name, beneath the
Acropolis, and not far at all from the intersection of Katharine
Hepburn Avenue and Archimedes Road.
How I nearly felt, in the midst of all that looking.
It was only the Parthenon, however, so beautiful in the after-
noon sun, that had touched a chord.
Still, for a time, I had almost wished to weep.
But then looked into a guide to the birds of Southern Con-
necticut and Long Island Sound, for what it might tell me about
seagulls.
Why I had wished to stop at Corinth was because of Medea
herself, as a matter of fact, even if the opera had nothing to do
with that at the time.
Although one doubts that there is any longer any evidence of
her little boys' graves in either case.
Then again, very likely there had been a pharmacy or a
movie theater with the name Savona on it, at the least, and I had
simply not been paying attention.
Although I am now next to positive that the numeral on the
back of the shirt was a seven.
Or a seventeen.
In fact it was a twelve.
Once, I was one hundred percent positive that I was in a town
called Lititz, in Pennsylvania, without having any genuine
reason for being positive about that at all.
As a matter of fact I had been equally positive, only moments
earlier, that I was in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, until a name on a
pharmacy or a movie theater indicated otherwise.
