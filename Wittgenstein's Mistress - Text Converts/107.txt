Even then, I also understood that there could easily be a
pharmacy in Lancaster called the Lititz Pharmacy, just as there
could be a movie theater in Savona called the Rimini. Or the
Perugia.
Nonetheless I was one hundred percent positive that I was in
Lititz, Pennsylvania.
I also believe that I was still wearing that same soccer shirt
now and again at the Tate Gallery, in London, on chilly
mornings when I was carrying in water from the Thames.
Or when I was enjoying Turner's own paintings of water.
I did not keep any of the additional shirts when I abandoned
that particular Volkswagen van, however, which only this
tardily has to strike me as thoughtless.
Obviously, since I so enjoyed wearing the one shirt, ordinary
common sense ought to have told me to keep some of the others.
Then again, doubtless I had no idea that I was going to
develop such a fondness for it, at the time.
For that matter it might just as easily have happened that I
waited for my own garments to dry completely, in which
instance I would have never developed any such feelings about
the shirt to begin with.
What was to have prevented me from listening to Maria
Callas singing Medea with nothing on at all, even, while I
waited?
Actually it was quite warm, as I remember.
But now heavens.
Obviously it would have hardly been Maria Callas singing
with nothing on, but only me myself listening that way.
What ridiculousness one's language still does insist upon
coming up with.
And in either event I had already put on the shirt.
And had also incidentally listened long enough to understand
that what Maria Callas was singing was not Medea by Luigi
Cherubini after all, but was Lucia di Lammerrnoor by
Gaetano Donizetti.
