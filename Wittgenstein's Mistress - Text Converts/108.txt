It was the famous mad scene in the latter which finally led me
to understand this.
Gaetano Donizetti being still another person whom I other-
wise might have mixed up with Vincenzo Bellini. Or with
Gentile Bellini, who was also Andrea Mantegna's brother-in-
law, being Giovanni Bellini's brother.
Well, I did mix him up. With Luigi Cherubini.
Music is not my trade.
Although Maria Callas singing that particular scene has
always sent shivers up and down my spine.
When Vincent Van Gogh was mad, he actually once tried to
eat his pigments.
Well, and Maupassant, eating something much more dread-
ful than that, poor soul.
That list becomes distressingly longer.
Even Turner, in his way, having such a phobia about not
letting a single person ever see him at work.
As a matter of fact Euripides was said to have lived in a cave,
for that identical reason.
Although Gustave Flaubert once wrote Maupassant a letter,
telling him not to spend so much time rowing.
On my honor, Flaubert once wrote Maupassant that.
In fact the letter also told him not to spend so much time with
prostitutes either.
Had he wished, Flaubert could have written this same letter
to Brahms, come to think about it, although I know of no record
of that.
Actually, he could have even written only part of the same
letter to Brahms, and the earlier part to Alfred North
Whitehead.
When Gertrude Stein first met Alfred North Whitehead, she
said that a little bell rang in her head, informing her that he was
a genius.
The only other time Gertrude Stein had ever heard the same
bell was when she first met Picasso.
