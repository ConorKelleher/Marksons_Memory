they had become less loose than on the others.
For perhaps an hour I opened cans and hit tennis balls across
one of the nets.
There were no nets, those having been ruined by weather
some time before as well.
Well, there were remnants of nets.
One pretends they are more than remnants.
Or that one of them is more than that, which is all that is
required to hit tennis balls across.
Many of the tennis balls did not bounce very well in spite of
having been in cans.
Or perhaps this was because of the grass, growing through
the surface of the courts.
To tell the truth I had never been especially proficient at
tennis in either case.
In fact I had almost never played tennis.
All of the balls are still at the side of the road, by the way.
Frequently I notice them in going or coming from the town.
Well, I noticed them just the other day.
There are the tennis balls I hit that afternoon, was what I
thought.
Happily, this is not the same thing as noticing smoke and
thinking, there is my house, since what I am noticing in such
instances are always real tennis balls.
One finds it agreeable to be positive as to what one is talking
about at least part of the time.
I have not forgotten Kirsten Flagstad.
After I had stopped hitting the tennis balls I was quite sweaty.
There were several vehicles parked nearby.
Often, the air-conditioning in certain vehicles will still
function.
Had I been at the beach, I would have gone into the ocean.
Not being at the beach, I started one of the vehicles.
Kirsten Flagstad was singing the Four Last Songs, by
Strauss.
