politan Museum to the other in my wheelchair.
All of this has been purely happenstance.
The fact that I have also mentioned a book about baseball is
surely not to be construed as implying that I possess any
enthusiasm for baseball.
To tell the truth I do not believe I have a favorite com-
poser.
Curiously, however, for a certain period not too long ago, all
that I was ever able to hear was The Seasons, by Vivaldi.
Even when I would be positive I had something else in mind,
The Seasons would be repeatedly what I heard.
Such things can happen.
They can happen with art just as readily.
Now and again I will be convinced that I am thinking about a
certain painting, for instance, and what will come into my head
will be a different painting altogether.
Just the other morning this happened with The Descent from
the Cross, by Rogier van der Weyden.
Right at this moment I can see that painting.
Doubtless this is only natural, since I am again thinking
about it.
Even if I had not been thinking about it, for that matter,
certainly I would have had to begin to do so when I typed those
last few sentences.
Nonetheless, when I was thinking about it just the other
morning, I did not see The Descent from the Cross at all.
What I saw was that painting by Jan Vermeer of a young
woman asleep at a table in the Metropolitan Museum.
There I go again.
Obviously, the young woman is no more asleep at a table in
the Metropolitan Museum than Maria Callas was undressed at
that embankment near Savona.
The young woman is asleep in a painting in the Metropolitan
Museum.
There is something wrong with that sentence too, of course.
