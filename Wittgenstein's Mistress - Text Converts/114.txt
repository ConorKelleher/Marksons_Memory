There being no young woman either, but only a representa-
tion of one.
Which is again why I am generally delighted to see the tennis
balls.
But all I had started to say, in either case, was that I had not
been thinking about that particular painting at all, even though
that was the painting that came into my head.
Although what I was more specifically trying to solve was
why I would keep on hearing The Seasons, by Vivaldi, even
when I was thinking about Les Troyens, by Berlioz, say. Or
about The Alto Rhapsody.
For that matter why am I now suddenly seeing an interior by
Jan Steen when I would have sworn I was thinking about one
painting by Rogier van der Weyden and still another by Jan
Vermeer?
All of Vivaldi's music, including The Seasons, was totally
forgotten for many years after he died, incidentally.
Well, and Vermeer was neglected for even longer.
In fact nobody ever bought a single painting by Vermeer
when he was still alive.
Vivaldi also had red hair.
As did Odysseus.
The things one knows.
Even if, conversely, I cannot call to mind one solitary item
about Jan Steen.
Or that all I am able to state categorically about Rogier van
der Weyden is that one still cannot see the original of The
Descent from the Cross the way it wants to be seen.
In spite of the windows having been washed nearby.
Or even if I also only now realize that everybody in it is as
Jewish as everybody in The Last Supper, presumably.
There is nobody in the painting called The Descent from the
Cross by Rogier van der Weyden, whatever any of them may
believe in.
Shapes do not have religion.
