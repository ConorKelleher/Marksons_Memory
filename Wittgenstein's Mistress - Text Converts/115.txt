And doubtless it was somebody else, later on, who decided to
name them the Four Last Songs.
My favorite composer is Bach, as a matter of fact, whom I do
not believe I have mentioned at all in these pages.
I have just realized something else.
On the front seat of the vehicle in which I turned on the air-
conditioning, after having gotten sweaty from hitting the tennis
balls, there was a paperback edition of The Way of All Flesh,
by Samuel Butler.
Which presumably answers the question as to where I came
upon the footnote about Samuel Butler having said that it was a
woman who wrote the Odyssey.
Or perhaps the book contained some sort of preface, dealing
with the life of Samuel Butler, which brought up this fact.
I am more than positive that I have never read a life of
Samuel Butler, however, even in the form of a preface, what
with knowing even less about Samuel Butler than I do about
The Way ofAll Flesh, which I am just as positive I have never
read.
And doubtless I would have scarcely looked into the book on
that particular afternoon in either case.
If only because of having set fire to the pages of a life of
Brahms not long before, in trying to simulate seagulls, surely I
would have wished to devote my attention to the tape deck
instead.
Even if there is still another life of Brahms somewhere in this
house.
I have no idea why I have said somewhere when I know
exactly where.
The life of Brahms is in the identical room into which I put
the painting of this house, which until a few days ago had been
on the wall directly above and to the side of where this type-
writer is.
The door to that room is closed.
Sea air has contributed to that deterioration.
