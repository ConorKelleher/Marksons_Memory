of music entirely, meanwhile.
When I say one can be hearing a different piece of music
entirely, by the way, I scarcely mean that one will hear the
entire piece of music. What I mean is that one hears an entirely
different composition, obviously.
Possibly I did not need to make that explanation.
At any rate what is now in my head is that painting by Jan
Vermeer again.
Although what I am more exactly thinking about is the
sentence I typed just a few pages ago, in which I said that the
young woman is asleep in the Metropolitan Museum.
Unquestionably, where the young woman is asleep is in
Delft, which is in Holland, and which is where Jan Vermeer
painted.
Well, Jan Vermeer of Delft being what he was generally
called, in fact.
Nonetheless, what has now struck me is that there is
undeniably a way in which the young woman is likewise asleep
in the Metropolitan Museum after all.
Unless for some reason the painting itself is no longer in the
museum, which one can sincerely doubt.
Even if I had had need of the frame, I would have nailed the
painting back into place.
I always took the time to do that, by the way. No matter how
chilly it happened to be at the moment.
Once, in the National Gallery, I did crack a canvas by Carel
Fabritius, but not so badly that I was not able to wax it and tape
the back.
But be that as it may, if I can sincerely doubt that the other
painting is not not in the Metropolitan, then it is a fact that the
young woman is asleep in the Metropolitan also.
As it is also a fact that in the painting by Rogier van der
Weyden they are taking Jesus down from the cross at Calvary,
but they are also taking him down on the top floor of the Prado,
in Madrid.
