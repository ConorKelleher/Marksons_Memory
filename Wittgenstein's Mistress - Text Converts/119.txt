Maupassant eating his lunch every day at the Eiffel Tower is
very likely connected to something, just as inevitably.
Even forgetting that I have just eaten my own lunch, or that
Maupassant was even more mad than Van Gogh.
In fact I would almost be willing to wager that there is some
way in which Maupassant is even connected to the soccer shirt
with the name Savona on its front, should one wish to pursue
such a question.
I cannot conceive of why anyone would wish to pursue such a
question.
And actually I never really knew what it was, about wearing

Although Maupassant's rowing is now in my mind again, too.
Had I held onto the shirt, doubtless I might have worn it when

In fact it is perhaps unfortunate that I did not hold onto the lot
of those shirts, in which case I might have worn a different one
each time I rowed.
What I find interesting about this notion is that from the front
it would have always looked as if I were wearing the same shirt.

And in any event I have practically never worn a shirt, while
rowing.
Very likely I was not wearing anything on the day when I
