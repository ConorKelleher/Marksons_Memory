played tennis either, to tell the truth.
I am still having my period, by the way.
Having my period is another matter I do not particularly
mean to give any weight to.
In this case it is just something that happens to be happening.
Although I have lost track of how long it is now, actually.
Doubtless I could look back through what I have been
writing, and try to calculate that. But I am fairly certain that I
have not indicated all of the days.
Sometimes I indicate them and sometimes I do not.
Lately I have often merely stopped typing and then started
again, without putting in that it is tomorrow.
I did not put in throwing away the lilacs either, which was at
least yesterday.
And doubtless if I did look back I would be distracted by
other things I have written anyhow.
In fact without looking back at all, but by merely thinking
about doing so, I have now remembered that a prostitute with
whom Van Gogh once lived was named Sien.
Something I doubtless did put in, somewhere, is that I once
knew a great deal about many painters.
Well, I knew a great deal about many painters for the same
reason that Menelaus must surely have known a great deal
about Paris, say.
Even if I seem to have skipped Rogier van der Weyden and
Jan Steen.
Somehow I would also appear to know that Bach had eleven
children, however.
Or perhaps it was twenty children.
Then again it may have been Vermeer who had eleven
children.
Though possibly what I have in mind is that Vermeer left
only twenty paintings.
Leonardo left fewer than that, perhaps only fifteen.
Not one of these figures may be correct.
