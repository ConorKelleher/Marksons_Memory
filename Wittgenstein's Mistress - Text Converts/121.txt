Fifteen paintings do not seem like very many, especially
when several of them are not even finished.
Or are deteriorating.
Then again it is perhaps quite a lot if one is Leonardo.
Actually Vermeer left forty paintings.
Brahms had no children at all, although he was known for
carrying candy in his pocket to give to the children of other
people, when he visited people who had children. -41
And at least we have finally solved the question as to which
life of Brahms it was that I read.
Surely a history of music written for children, and printed in
extraordinarily large type, would place emphasis on the fact
that somebody being written about in that very book was known
for carrying candy in his pocket to give to children when he
visited people who had children.
Even if Brahms had not done this very often, surely it would
have been emphasized there.
In fact it is not even impossible that Brahms hardly ever
carried candy in his pocket to give to children.
Very possibly Brahms did not even do this more than once in
his life, and the entire legend was based on that single
incident.
Helen ran off with a lover only once in her life herself, and for
three thousand years nobody would ever let her forget it.
Here is some candy, children, Brahms doubtless said, once.
Brahms gave candy to children, somebody wrote.
The latter statement is in no way untrue. Any more than it is
untrue that Helen was unfaithful.
Although when one comes right down to it, who is to say that
Brahms may even have not liked children?
Or even disliked them, to the extreme?
As a matter of fact quite possibly the only reason Brahms
ever gave candy to any of them, even the once, may have been
so they would go away altogether.
Actually, Leonardo did not have children either, although
