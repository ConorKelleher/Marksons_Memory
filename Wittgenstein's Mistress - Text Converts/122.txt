nothing appears to have been said about candy either way, in
his instance.
Still, so much for your basic legend.
So much for solving the question as to which life of Brahms it
was that I read, as well, since what I have also now just
remembered is the affair that Brahms perhaps had with Clara
Schumann.
I say perhaps, since it would appear that nobody has ever
quite solved this, either.
Assuredly there would have been no hint of it in the history of
music written for children, however.
Doubtless what Van Gogh wished was to reform Sien, when
he invited her to live with him.
This was before he cut off his ear, I believe.
Often, in reading about Van Gogh, one gets the impression
he must have been the first person to say hello to Dostoievski,
in St. Petersburg.
Actually, it strikes me as quite agreeable to think of Brahms
having had an affair with Clara Schumann.
Once, when I was a girl, I saw a film about music in Vienna,
called Song of Love.
All I can remember about the film is that everybody took
turns playing the piano.
But also that Katharine Hepburn had the part of Clara
Schumann.
So perhaps it is the notion of Brahms having had an affair
with somebody like Katharine Hepburn which strikes me as so
agreeable.
Especially if his affair with Jane Avril did not last.
And even ill have no idea what I have been saying that has
now reminded me that Bach was almost blind, before he died.
This was from copying too many scores late at night. if I
remember.
Homer was blind too, of course.
Although possibly this was only something that was said,
