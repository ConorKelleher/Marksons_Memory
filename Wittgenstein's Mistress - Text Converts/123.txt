insofar as Homer was concerned.
I believe I have already mentioned that there were no pencils,
then.
Which is to say that when people said Homer was blind, it
was because what they really did not wish to say was that
Homer did not know how to write.
Emily Brontë was one more person who did not have children.
Well, doubtless it would have been extraordinarily interesting
if Emily Bronte did, what with the considerable likelihood that
she never even once had a lover.
Still, I would perhaps find it difficult to think of anybody I
would rather be descended from than Emily Brontë.
Unless Sappho, of course.
Well, or Helen.
To tell the truth, I may even have made believe that I was
Helen, once.
At Hisarlik, this would have been. Looking out across the
plains that once were Troy, and dreaming for a while that the
Greek ships were beached there still.
Or that one could even see the evening's watchfires, being
lighted along the shore.
Well, it would have been a harmless enough thing to make
believe.
Even if Troy itself was disappointingly small. Like little more
than your ordinary city block and a few stories in height,
practically.
Although now that I remember, everything in William
Shakespeare's house at Stratford -on -Avon was astonishingly
tiny, too. As if only imaginary people had lived there then.
Or perhaps it is only the past itself, which is always smaller
than one had believed.
I do wish that that last sentence had some meaning, since it
certainly came close to impressing me for a moment
There is a great deal of sadness in the Iliad in either case,
incidentally.
