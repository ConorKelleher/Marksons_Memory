Well, all that death. Wrist deep in that, and in loss, so many
of them so often being.
But too, with all of it so long ago, and forever gone.
On the way to certain of his own conquests, Alexander the
Great once stopped at Troy himself, to lay a wreath at
Achilles's grave.
That older war seeming so much closer to then than to now,
of course.
Still, even by the time of Alexander, it was almost a thousand
years.
I can almost not conceive of that, come to think about it.
Julius Caesar laid a wreath at Achilles's grave, as well.
Although that was only about three hundred years after
Alexander.
When I say only, what I imagine I mean is that it was prac-
tically as close as between Shakespeare and today, for
instance.
In which case I have unquestionably now lost track of what I
was trying to conceive of altogether.
Bertrand Russell was born fifteen years before Rupert
Brooke, and was still alive more than fifty years after Brooke
had died on Scyros, if that is perhaps connected to anything?
If I have not mentioned having been at Stratford -on -Avon
before, by the way, this is only because I assume it is taken for
granted that everybody who goes to London will sooner or later
also go to Stratford -on -Avon.
London and Stratford -on -Avon always remaining equidistant
from each other too, as it happens.
Whatever the people who wrote the instructions in Japanese
about situating phonograph speakers may have believed.
And in the meantime I would appear to have let still another
day pass without putting that one in, either.
As a matter of fact I did not sit here at all, yesterday.
For some reason, what I felt like doing yesterday was dis-
mantling.
