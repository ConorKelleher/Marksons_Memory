Although after that I went for a ride in the pickup truck, as far
as to the garbage disposal area.
The tires on the pickup truck are getting a little soft.
Have I said that on certain mornings, when the leaves are
dewy, some of them are like jewels where the earliest sunlight
glistens?
It is what I sometimes have instead of a rosy -fingered dawn,
possibly.
Possibly the garbage disposal area is one more thing that I
have never mentioned before, as well.
One would have little reason to do so, however, it being
nothing more extraordinary than a hole in the ground.
It is quite a huge hole, but still.
One follows a sign, to get there.
To the Garbage Disposal Area, the sign says.
In a manner of speaking, one follows the sign.
What one is actually following is a road, of course.
Possibly I did not need to make that explanation.
My own garbage is always meager enough to be disposed of
by being buried on the beach, incidentally.
I do this while taking my walks, perhaps every third time I
take one.
And doubtless it goes without saying that any such garbage
as had once been disposed of at the hole has long since
decomposed.
So that the hole is just a hole, as I have said.
Although there is an enormous heap of broken bottles nearby.
Perhaps the latter is somewhat extraordinary, after all.
Certainly the bottles are extraordinarily pretty, being of
various colors.
Too, they glisten much more dramatically than do my wet
morning leaves.
In fact the entire mound of them is sometimes like a kind of
glistening sculpture.
Michelangelo would not have thought so, but I think so.
