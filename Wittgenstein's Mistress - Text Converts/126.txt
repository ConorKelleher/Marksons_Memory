Sculpture is the art of taking away superfluous material,
Michelangelo once said.
He also said, conversely, that painting is the art of adding
things on.
Although doubtless he would not have thought that the heap
of added -on bottles is like a painting, either.
Yet it is not one hundred percent unlike a painting by Van
Gogh at that, when one comes right down to it.
If one squints just a little, it is even very like a painting by Van

Starry Night.
As a matter of fact, at night is exactly when Van Gogh would
have most probably chosen to paint such bottles.
Assuming there was a moon, obviously.
El Greco was fond of painting at night also, but only indoors.
And one seriously doubts that El Greco would have been given
inspiration by a garbage disposal area, in either case.
Actually, the bottles could be effectively done by the light of
a fire, as well.
Even if it would have to be quite a large fire.
Now and again I have built fires along the beach, by the way.
This is always a pleasant diversion.
This is also not including when I have built other sorts of fires
along the beach. Such as out of entire houses.
Doubtless it has generally been on an unexpectedly chilly
evening in summer, when I have built the former.
Or on the first evenings when one senses that winter is finally
almost ending.
Along the sand there will be frisky shadows, that will dance
and fall away.
Or, if there is snow, the flames will write a strange calligraphy
whiteness.
