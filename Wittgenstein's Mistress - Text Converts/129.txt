On my honor, that was how things worked, then.
So possibly the drugstore I forgot to notice in Savona was not
called the Savona Drugstore to begin with, but was named after
Gauguin.
In Madrid, I once lived in a hotel named after Zurbaran.
Unless perhaps it was named after Goya.
And was in Pamplona.
Although what I would more seriously wish to know is why
any of this is now making me think about seagulls.
Aha. Seagulls being scavengers, of course.
When I say being, I mean having been, naturally.
But which in either case was only to suggest that there surely
once would have been any number of seagulls at the garbage
disposal area.
One has no idea how great a number, but surely a considerable
number.
Doubtless other creatures would have come and gone also, of
course.
Such as dogs and cats, one imagines.
Then again, perhaps even large dogs would have been leery
of that many seagulls.
Certainly cats would have been.
Unless of course there were a considerable number of cats,
basically approximating the considerable number of seagulls,
which one sincerely doubts.
Actually all I had in mind was a house cat or two, put out for
the night.
Once, when I was painting in Corinth, New York, for a
summer, I put my own cat out each night.
I remember this because the cat was a city cat and had never
been put out before.
Every night for weeks, I worried about that cat.
As a matter of fact I felt quite guilty as well, even though I
was never quite certain what it was that I was feeling quite
guilty about.
