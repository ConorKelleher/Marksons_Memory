Surely a cat which has been locked up in a loft in SoHo for all
of its life will find it agreeable being outside at night, I attempted
to convince myself.
Possibly it will even find other cats to associate with, which it

If one wishes to see a cat badly enough, one will doubtless see
one.
Though possibly there was a cat. Possibly it was only the
rigged up floodlights, which made it leery.
