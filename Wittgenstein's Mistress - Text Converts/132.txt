taneously solved the question of my russet cat's name after all.
In fact now that it has come back to me, it could not have
come back more vividly.
Practically every single day at Corinth, for instance, when I
did remember to let the cat back in, I said good morning to it.
Good morning, Rembrandt, being exactly how I said it prac-
tically every single time.
Russet as a color that one automatically associates with
Rembrandt having been the origin of this, naturally.
Even if russet is perhaps not a color.
In any case it is surely not a color that has anything to do with
painting, although admittedly it may be a color that has some-

Although not being a painting a cat can be russet too.

found to be a perfectly suitable name, on an afternoon when the
identical cat happened to climb into his lap.
Perhaps I have not mentioned that my russet cat climbed into
Willem de Kooning's lap.

was visiting at my loft, in SoHo.
I have forgotten the date of this visit, but I do believe it was
not long after the afternoon on which Robert Rauschenberg had
also visited, and I had hastily hidden my drawings.
Then again, the reason for Willem de Kooning having
approved of the cat's name may have actually had less to do
with the cat being russet than with Rembrandt having been
Dutch, when one stops to think about it.
Being Dutch himself, de Kooning would have naturally felt
certain ties to Rembrandt.
One scarcely means family ties, of course, since one would
have surely known about this, had any existed.
Willem de Kooning is descended from Rembrandt, one
