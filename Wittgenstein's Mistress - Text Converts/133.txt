would have heard.
Then again, who is to argue that he might not have been
descended from somebody who had at least once met
Rembrandt, on the other hand, which even de Kooning himself
would have doubtless not been aware of?
Or from somebody who had been a pupil of Rembrandt,
even?
Surely it would have been easy to lose track, after so many
years.
How many people would have ever guessed that Maria
Callas could be traced all the way back to Hermione, for
instance?
Actually, something like this could have been all the more
likely if the pupil de Kooning was descended from had never
become famous himself, which is generally what happens in
any event.
Many pupils not only fail to become famous, in fact, but
eventually even go into a different line of work altogether.
Why couldn't Willem de Kooning have been descended from
a pupil of Rembrandt who had decided he did not have any
future as a painter and had become a baker instead, let us say?
Sooner or later, surely, the man's descendants would have
had no idea that anybody in the family had ever been a pupil of
Rembrandt at all.
Father was a pupil of Rembrandt before we opened the
pastry shop, one can imagine being said. Or even, grandfather
was a pupil of Rembrandt.
Certainly it would have stopped being passed down long
before Willem de Kooning himself was alive, however.
As a matter of fact Claude Lorrain was actually a pastry
cook who decided to become a painter, and one would wager
that hardly any of his descendants could have named the man
who taught him to bake, either.
Then again, what I have been saying about pupils is not
necessarily always the case, as it happens.
