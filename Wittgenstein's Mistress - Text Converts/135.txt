[ 138]
Weyden had a pupil named Hans Memling, even though I
would have sworn categorically that I knew no such thing about
Rogier van der Weyden.
In any event almost every one of these is a pupil I am sure
Willem de Kooning would have found it agreeable to have been
descended from.
Well, doubtless he would have found it agreeable to have
been descended from Vincent Van Gogh as well, even if he was
born less than fifteen years after Van Gogh shot himself.
I am not quite certain how the second part of that sentence is
connected to the beginning part, actually.
Perhaps all I was thinking about was that Van Gogh was
Dutch too.
One of the things people generally admired about Van Gogh,
even though they were not always aware of it, was the way he
could make even a chair seem to have anxiety in it. Or a pair of
boots.
Cezanne once said that he painted like a madman, on the
other hand.
Still, perhaps I shall name the cat that scratches at my broken
window Van Gogh.
Or Vincent.
One does not name a piece of tape, however.
There is the piece of tape, scratching at my window. There is
Vincent, scratching at my window.
Well, it is not impossible. I suspect it is not very likely, but it
is not impossible.
Good morning, Vincent.
Van Gogh sold only one painting in his lifetime, incidentally.
Although that did put him one ahead of Jan Vermeer, at least.
Conversely I have no idea how many Jan Steen sold.
I do know that at the end of his life Botticelli was lame, and
had to live off charity.
Frans Hals had to live off charity, as well.
Well, and again Daumier.
