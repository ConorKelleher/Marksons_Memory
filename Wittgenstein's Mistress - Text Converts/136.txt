Too, Paolo Uccello was another who died poor and neglected.
As did the Piero who did not hide under tables.
So many lists keep on growing, and are saddening.
Even though the work itself lasts, of course.
Or does thinking about the work itself while knowing these
things somehow sadden one even more?
Even Rembrandt went bankrupt, finally.
This was in Amsterdam, which I make note of because it was
only a few short blocks away from where Spinoza was excom-
municated, and in the very same month.
I am assuming it will be understood that I hardly know that
because of knowing anything about Spinoza.
Assuredly, this was a footnote I did once read.
Although what I do only this instant realize is why Rembrandt
was always so easily fooled by those coins, of course.
Certainly if I myself were going bankrupt I would keep on
bending to pick up every coin I happened to notice, too.
Considering the circumstances, one would scarcely stop to
remember that one's pupils had contrived such illusions before.
Merciful heavens, there is a gold coin, one would surely
think. Right on the floor of my studio.
Let us hope it does not belong to some troublemaker who will
dash up to claim it either, one would think just as readily.

Although in the case of Rembrandt it might at least explain
why his pupils generally failed to become famous, or even went
