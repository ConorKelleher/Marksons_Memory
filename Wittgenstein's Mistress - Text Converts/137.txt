into different lines of work, what with the lot of them being so
insensitive.
In fact it was no doubt equally insensitive on my own part to
suggest that Willem de Kooning could have been descended
from anybody in such a bunch.
I had simply failed to carry my thinking far enough when I
made such a suggestion.
Oops.
Carel Fabritius was a pupil of Rembrandt.
Granting that Carel Fabritius was hardly as famous as
Rembrandt himself. Still, he was surely famous enough so that
Willem de Kooning doubtless could not have minded having
been descended from him after all.
As a matter of fact I believe that I myself have even
mentioned Carel Fabritius at least once, in some regard or
other.
I suppose all one can now do is hope for Willem de Kooning's
sake that Carel Fabritius was not one of the pupils who played
that mean trick.
Well, presumably he would not have been able to become
Rembrandt's best pupil to begin with, if he had wasted his time
in such a way.
Then again, quite possibly in being the best he was the only
pupil who had such time to waste.
Quite possibly whenever Rembrandt gave a quiz, for
instance, it was always Carel Fabritius who finished first, and
then devoted himself to mischief while everybody else was still
laboring to catch up.
Many questions in art history remain elusive in this manner,
unfortunately.
As a matter of fact Carel Fabritius may have had a pupil of
his own, named Jan Vermeer, but nobody was ever able to
verify that for certain, either.
Carel Fabritius died in Delft, however, which was one factor
that led to such speculation.
