I have pointed out Vermeer's own connection with Delft
elsewhere, I believe.
But as I have also pointed out, practically two hundred years
would have to pass before anybody would become interested
enough in Vermeer to look into such matters, and thus a great
deal would have already been lost track of.
Well, I have more than once noted how easily that can occur,
too.
One thing that does happen to be known is that Vermeer was
another painter who went bankrupt, however.
Although it was actually his wife who did that, not long after
Vermeer died.
As a matter of fact she owed a considerable bill to the local
baker.
This baker was also in Delft, of course, so one is willing to
assume it was not the same baker who had himself once been a
pupil of Rembrandt.
Then again this is perhaps not so certain an assumption after
all.
What with Caret Fabritius having recently moved from the
one city to the other, who is to argue that his old classmate
might not have done so, as well?
In addition to which, two of Vermeer's paintings had actually
been given to this same baker, as a kind of collateral.
Surely your ordinary baker would have been less than agree-
able about such an arrangement, and especially in the case of a
customer who had never sold a single painting in his life.
Unless of course the baker happened to be somebody who
knew something about art himself.
Or at any rate knew enough to go to somebody who was still
in the same line of work, for advice.
Tell me, Fabritius, what am Ito do about this pupil of yours,
who keeps on buying pastry for his eleven children? How long
must I wait before any of these paintings become worth
anything?
