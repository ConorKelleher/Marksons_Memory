Unfortunately there would appear to be no record of Care!
Fabiitius's answer, here.
Neither is there any in regard to the connection between
Rembrandt and Spinoza, actually, which it occurs to me I had
not intended to leave hanging as I did.
Even if there was no connection between Rembrandt and
Spinoza.
The only connection between Rembrandt and Spinoza was
that both of them were connected with Amsterdam.
Although on the other hand Rembrandt may have painted a
portrait of Spinoza.
People often made what they called an educated guess that
he had painted such a portrait, in any event.
Most of the subjects of Rembrandt's portraits being uniden-
tified to begin with, naturally.
So all that people were really doing was guessing that one of
them may as well have been Spinoza.
In the end this is one more of those questions in art history
that has always had to remain elusive, however.
On the other hand it is probably safe to assume that
Rembrandt and Spinoza surely would have at least passed on
the street, now and again.
Or even run into each other quite frequently, if only at some
neighborhood shop or other.
And certainly they would have exchanged amenities as well,
after a time.
Good morning, Rembrandt. Good morning to you, Spinoza.
I was extremely sorry to hear about your bankruptcy,
Rembrandt. I was extremely sorry to hear about your excom-
munication, Spinoza.
Do have a good day, Rembrandt. Do have the same, Spinoza.
All of this would have been said in Dutch, incidentally.
I mention that simply because it is known that Rembrandt did
not speak any other language except Dutch.
Even if Spinoza may have preferred Latin. Or Jewish.
