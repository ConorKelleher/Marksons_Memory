had been a painter named Taddeo Gaddi.
As I have suggested, certainly many people would not have
been aware of that.
Then again, if one were named William Gaddis, doubtless
one would have gone through life being aware of it.
As a matter of fact people had probably been driving William
Gaddis to distraction for years, by asking him if he were aware
that there had been a painter named Taddeo Gaddi.
Possibly I was sensible enough not to ask him.
In fact I hope I did not even ask him if he knew that Taddeo
Gaddi had been a pupil of Giotto.
Well, doubtless I would not have asked him that, having not
even known I remembered it until the instant in which I started
to type that sentence.
And in any event the cat may not have climbed into William
Gaddis's lap after all.
The more I think about it, the more I seem to remember that
Rembrandt rarely went anywhere near strangers.
Even if he and William Gaddis would have remained equi-
distant from each other at all times, of course.
Well, as any other cat and any other person.
Or even as the cat I saw in the Colosseum and each of those
cans of food I put out, also.
Even though there were as many cans as there must have
,been Romans watching the Christians, practically.
In fact each Christian and each lion would have always
remained equidistant from each other, too.
Except when the lions had eaten the former, naturally.
Although I can now actually think of another exception to
this rule, as well.
I myself and the cat which is presently scratching at my
broken window again might both normally be presumed to be
equidistant from each other, too.
Except when the tape happens to stop scratching, at which
time there is no cat.
