And surely one cannot be equidistant from something that
does not exist, any more than something that does not exist can
be equidistant from whatever it is supposed to be equidistant
from either.
Or can any donkey see that?
It is easier to think about the cat as not existing than about
Vincent as not doing so, incidentally.
And meanwhile for some reason I am extraordinarily
pleased to have remembered that, about Taddeo Gaddi and
Giotto.
Well, and it makes for an interesting connection from
Cimabue to Giotto to Taddeo Gaddi, also.
Like the connection from Perugino to Raphael to Giulio
Romano.
Even ill have perhaps not mentioned that Raphael had been
a pupil of Perugino. Or for that matter that Perugino in turn had
been a pupil of the Piero who did not hide under tables, which
connects everything even farther than that.
In fact I have now suddenly solved the entire question as to
whom Willem de Kooning was descended from.
Willem de Kooning was not descended from anybody.
Willem de Kooning's teacher was.
Now heavens. Or should I perhaps give up troubling to
correct such nonsense altogether, and simply let my language
come out any way it insists upon?
In fact even before I just wrote that Willem de Kooning was
not descended from anybody, which was obviously hardly what
I meant, I happened to be thinking about Les Troyens again.
What I would have written about Les Troyens, if I had
stopped to put that in, was that nobody ever pays attention to a
word Cassandra says in the opera any more than they do in the
plays.
Except that if nobody ever pays attention to a word Cassandra
says, how can anybody know that nobody pays attention to her
to begin with?
