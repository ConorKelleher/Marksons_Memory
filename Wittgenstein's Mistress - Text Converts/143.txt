Now I suspect I have put that badly, as well.
Certain things can sometimes be almost impossible to put,
however.
Once, when I was in the seventh grade, the teacher told us
Archimedes's paradox about Achilles and the tortoise.
How the paradox went was that if Achilles was trying to
catch the tortoise, but the tortoise had a head start, Achilles
could never catch it.
This was because by the time Achilles had caught up the
distance of the head start, the tortoise would have naturally
gone another distance. And even though each new distance the
tortoise could go would keep on getting smaller and smaller,
Achilles would still always be that new distance behind.
Now I knew, knew, that Achilles could certainly catch that
tortoise.
Even when Achilles was only the tiniest fraction behind,
however, and the tortoise could go only the tiniest fraction past
that, what the teacher showed on the blackboard was that there
would still always be more fractions.
This finally almost made me want to cry.
So now I know that nobody ever pays attention to a word
Cassandra says in the opera, but I also know, know, that the
way I know it is by having paid attention.
Philosophy is not my trade.
And in fact it was not Archimedes who had the paradox but
was Zeno.
Archimedes was killed by soldiers during some war at
Syracuse while he was doing his geometry in the sand. With a
stick.
Or have I now just done it all over again?
Oh, well, I suppose it is not one hundred percent impossible
that Archimedes was killed with the same stick I was trying to
say he was writing with.
I have not forgotten Willem de Kooning's teacher.
