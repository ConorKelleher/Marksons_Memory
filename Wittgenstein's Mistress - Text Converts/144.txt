teacher, however, was not that I had suddenly realized whom
he was descended from, but whom he was connected to.
As in the connection from Rembrandt to Card Fabritius to
Vermeer, this obviously is.
Except that what I am now thinking about is the person who
was .next in line, as a pupil of Vermeer. And then the person
who was a pupil of the pupil of Vermeer.
And after that all the way down until the next to last pupil of a
pupil had a pupil of his own named Willem de Kooning.
Surely this is much more likely than Willem de Kooning
himself having been descended from the man who taught
Claude Lorrain how to make pastry?
Ralph Hodgson was born fifteen years before Rupert Brooke,
and was still alive almost fifty years after Brooke had died on
the same island where Achilles had made one of the women
pregnant.
And when Bertrand Russell was more than ninety years old,
he could still remember hearing his grandfather talk about
remembering the death of George Washington.
As a matter of fact, suppose one day when Willem de
Kooning was a pupil, his teacher told him something.
Suppose this was something quite simple, even, such as that
russet is not a name one gives to a color.
But also suppose that when Willem de Kooning's teacher
said that, he was really repeating something he had been told
when he himself was a pupil.
And suppose that the teacher who told it to Willem de
Kooning's teacher had been told the same thing when he
himself was a pupil.
And so on.
So who is to argue that one day Rembrandt might not have
been standing next to Care! Fabritius's easel, and Care!
Fabritius said he was going to paint something russet, and
Rembrandt said that russet is a color one calls a bedspread?
So in a manner of speaking Willem de Kooning was actually
