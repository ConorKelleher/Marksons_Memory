a pupil of Rembrandt.
This is scarcely to suggest that it was Willem de Kooning
who painted the gold coins on the floor of Rembrandt's studio,
of course.
Although who is to additionally argue that he might not have
finished that quiz even more quickly than Carel Fabritius did?
Come to think about it, however, why is it not possible that
all of this might go back even farther still?
Why couldn't it just as readily have been Cimabue who told
Giotto about bedspreads, for instance, even long before Gilbert
Stuart happened to mention it in passing to George Washington?
This is scarcely to suggest that Willem de Kooning was
anywhere in the vicinity when Giotto was drawing the perfect
circle freehand either, of course.
Unless, on the other hand, I suddenly make up my mind to
imagine that he was.
This very sort of imagining being the artist's privilege,
obviously.
Well, it is what artists do.
There is a famous canvas in the National Gallery, of
Penelope weaving, and nobody stopped the painter from
putting everybody from Ithaca into clothes that people did not
wear until practically three thousand years later, during the
Renaissance.
In fact it was similarly Leonardo's own doing when he made
the table in The Last Supper far too small for all of those Jewish
people who are supposed to be eating at it.
Or Michelangelo's, when he took away superfluous material
on his David but left the hands and feet too big.
I have now made up my mind to imagine Willem de Kooning
in Giotto's studio.
In fact Giotto is wearing clothes from the Renaissance, but
Willem de Kooning is in a kind of sweatshirt.
Actually I have just made the sweatshirt into a soccer shirt.
With the word Savona across its front.
