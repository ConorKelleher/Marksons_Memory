Giotto and Willem de Kooning are both equidistant from
each other, naturally.
Well, and from the circle.
In fact all points on the circumference of the circle are equi-
distant from the center of the circle as well, as Zeno proved.
And now Cimabue and Rembrandt and Care! Fabritius and
Jan Vermeer are in the studio also.
There is nothing astonishing in my ability to arrange any of
this, of course, although in certain ways it is perhaps interesting.
What is especially interesting is that I do not have any idea
what Giotto or Cimabue or Jan Vermeer look like.
In the case of Rembrandt and Carel Fabritius I have seen
self-portraits. Even if it does not appear necessary for me to
visualize which of the many of those on Rembrandt's part
happens to apply at the moment.
Willem de Kooning is a special case as well, having once
visited my loft.
As a matter of fact I have now put my russet cat into Giotto's
studio, also.
Even if russet is traditionally not a name anybody present
would give to a color.
I think I will put the cat that scratches at my broken window
in, too.
Both cats are now in Giotto's studio.
I suspect I would prefer that Rembrandt not discover what
the first of these cats is named, however.
Although in fact Willem de Kooning is aware of the name of
that one.
I have no way of telling whether Willem de Kooning might
mention to Rembrandt what that cat's name is.
Even though it is I who am imagining Willem de Kooning
and Rembrandt in the same studio, I would appear not to have
any control over this.
Then again it is quite possible that Willem de Kooning does
not remember the cat's name in either case, it being some years
