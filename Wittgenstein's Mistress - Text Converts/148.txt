more, as it happens, is because it is in the room with the life of
Brahms, and the atlas, and to which the door is closed.
But which has therefore now brought the life of Brahms and
the atlas into my head, likewise.
Although what I am next forced to wonder is what might
happen if I were to decide that I have Brahms himself in my
head.
Would it be the real Brahms, or the Brahms from the life of
Brahms?
And which one of them wrote The Alto Rhapsody, then?
Or do I perhaps have no idea what on earth I mean by this
distinction?
At least it has suddenly occurred to me that the Achilles from
the seventh grade who could not catch the tortoise is the same
Achilles I have been writing about for all of this time.
Well, it had simply not struck me that way before, is all.
Even if I now realize that this means the tortoise was faster
than Hector was too, since Achilles did finally catch Hector,
even though Hector ran and ran.
Then again, I doubt that the tortoise was the same tortoise
that an eagle was said to have dropped on Aeschylus's bald
head, which is how Aeschylus was said to have died.
There is an explanation for the eagle having done this,
incidentally.
The explanation being that presumably the eagle wished to
crack the shell of the tortoise, and believed that Aeschylus's
bald head was a rock.
On my honor, it was said that this was how Aeschylus died.
When Aeschylus wrote about all of that bloody business in
the bath with Agamemnon and Clytemnestra and the net, by
the way, he put in a terribly sad part for while Cassandra is
waiting to die herself.
What Cassandra thinks about is how lovely everything had
been when she was a little girl, at Troy, and used to sit and play.
Beside the banks of the Scamander.
