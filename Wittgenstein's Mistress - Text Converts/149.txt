This being another sort of thing that artists do.
Then again Cassandra is not carried off to Greece at all, in
Les Troyens.
What Berlioz does, instead, is have her kill herself, once
Troy falls.
Perhaps Hector Berlioz was named after the same Hector
also, come to think about it.
I do not remember anything in the opera about anybody
lurking at windows, on the other hand.
Although it was Herodotus who wrote the line about the
entire war having been because of a single Spartan girl, which I
do believe I was trying to remember a good number of days ago.
Raphael and Giulio Romano were two more artists who
painted versions of Helen being abducted, incidentally, just as
Rubens and Van Dyck both painted versions of Achilles hiding
among the women.
I find it interesting, when teachers and pupils do that.
Although Rubens was sometimes not very much happier
about Van Dyck than Titian was about Tintoretto, actually.
Even if he did not kick Van Dyck out, what he did was always
give him just faces to do, so that he himself could keep on being
the best at the parts where everybody is always touching every-
body else.
Rubens also spoke five languages, which I mention only be-
cause of having mentioned that Rembrandt could speak only one.
Have I said that I brought in an armful of red roses, earlier
this morning?
Or that Utrillo actually painted certain canvases by copying
scenes he found on picture postcards?
Meantime that question of things existing only in one's head
may still be troubling me slightly, to tell the truth.
Basically this is because it has just now come to mind that the
fire I am perhaps
going
to build at the garbage disposal area, in
order to watch it glisten on the broken bottles, is something else
that exists only in my head.
