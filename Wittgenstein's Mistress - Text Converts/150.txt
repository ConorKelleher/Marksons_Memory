Except that in this case it is something that exists in my head
even though I have not yet built the fire.
In fact it exists in my head even if! may possibly never build
the fire.
Moreover, what is really in my head is not the fire either, but
that painting by Van Gogh of the fire.
Which is to say the painting by Van Gogh that one can see if
one squints just a little. With all of those swirls, as in The Starry
Night.
And with anxiety in it, even.
Even if a certain amount of the anxiety may be simply over
the likelihood that the painting will not sell, of course.
Although as a matter of fact what has now suddenly happened
is that I am not actually seeing the painting itself, but am seeing
a reproduction of the painting.
In addition to which the reproduction even has a caption,
which says that the painting is called The Broken Bottles.
And is in the Uffizi.
Now obviously there is no painting by Van Gogh called The
Broken Bottles in the Uffizi.
There is no painting by Van Gogh called The Broken Bottles
anywhere, in fact, including even in my head, since as I have
said what is in my head is only a reproduction of the painting.
I suspect I am getting mixed up.
All I had started to say, I think, is that I am seeing a painting
that Van Gogh did not paint, and which has now become a
reproduction of that painting, and which to begin with is of a fire
that! myself have not built.
Although what I have entirely left out is that the painting is
not actually of the fire either, but of a reflection of the fire.
So in other words what I am ultimately seeing is not only a
painting which is not a real painting but is only a reproduction,
but which is also a painting of a fire which is not a real fire but is
only a reflection.
On top of which the reproduction is hardly a real reproduction
