Dictys of Crete, or Dares the Phrygian, or Quintus from
Smyrna, to learn such things, since the Iliad does not go that far.
I dropped the pages from those books into the fire after
reading the reverse sides of each too, as I recall.
In the Louvre, this would have been, which is perhaps three
bridges away from the Pont Neuf.
Once, that same winter, I signed a mirror. In one of the
women's rooms, with a lipstick.
What I was signing was an image of myself, naturally.
Should anybody else have looked, where my signature would
have been was under the other person's image, however.
Even in late spring, from the ruins at Hisarlik, one can still
see snow on Paris's mountain.
There is a painting in the Louvre of Helen and Paris, by the
way, by Jacques Louis David, which is perhaps the only con-
vincing representation of Helen that I have ever seen.
As a matter of fact the painting itself is silly, since Helen has
all her clothes on while Paris is wearing only sandals and a hat.
Still, there is a wistfulness in Helen's face, that suggests that
she has been thinking about a good many things.
I am quite taken by the idea of Helen having been thinking
about a good many things.
Doubtless I would never have signed that minor had there
been anybody else to look, on the other hand.
Though in fact the name J put down was Jeanne Hëbuterne.
I am also still staining, incidentally.
At a guess, I would say it is nine or ten days, now.
I would appear to have been failing to indicate a good many
more of the latter too, as it happens.
Even if that has nothing to do with the staining, which as I
have said is scarcely unusual.
Any more than would be waiting for some months without
getting my period at all.
Although I have had to go to the spring again, to wash fresh
underpants.
