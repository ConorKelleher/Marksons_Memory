Ah, me.
Naturally I did not wash fresh underpants. Naturally the
underpants were not fresh until after I had washed them.
In either case I have also left everything outside once more,
since there is always something pleasurable about changing
into garments that are still warm from the sun.
Conversely I am not extraordinarily happy about this new
habit of skipping days so frequently, to tell the truth, even if I
am less than positive why.
Although possibly it has something to do with the question I
was writing about yesterday.
By which I perhaps mean a day or two before yesterday.
Nor am I certain that I remember the question very clearly.
Or perhaps I did not define it that well.
Although doubtless all I have in mind is that if so many things
would appear to exist only in my head, once I do sit here they
then turn out to exist on these pages as well.
Presumably they exist on these pages.
If somebody were to look at these pages who could under-
stand only Russian, I have no idea what would exist on these
pages.
Not speaking one word of Russian myself, however, I believe
I am able to state categorically that the things which had existed
only in my head now also exist on these pages.
Well, some of such things.
One can hardly put down everything that exists in one's
head.
Or even begin to be aware of it, obviously.
In fact I have no doubt that I have more than once written
things that I did not even remember I remembered until I wrote
them.
Well, I have commented on that.
Though as a matter of fact there are also certain things that
one remembers while one is writing that one did not remember
one remembered but does not happen to put down, either.
