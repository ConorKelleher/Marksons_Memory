[157J
For instance when I was writing about the fact that
Rembrandt and Spinoza had lived in Amsterdam at the same
time, which I had learned from a footnote, I suddenly remem-
bered from a different footnote entirely that when El Greco had
lived in Toledo such people as St. Teresa and St. John of the
Cross had lived there, too.
Even though I remembered that, however, I did not put it
down.
Basically my reason for not doing so may have been because
I do not know one solitary thing about either St. Teresa or St.
John of the Cross.
Except obviously that they were both in Toledo when El
Greco was in Toledo.
Although there is more to what I am talking about than this.
Still another person who lived in Toledo when El Greco lived
in Toledo was Cervantes, except that I had a different sort of
reason for not bringing up Cervantes just now when I brought
up St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross.
When I brought up St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross it
was because, as I said, I had thought about them in connection
with El Greco at the time when I was thinking about Rembrandt
in connection with Spinoza.
As I also said, however, the fact that El Greco may have
known St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross was something! did
not remember I remembered until the very moment in which I
was writing what I wrote about Rembrandt and Spinoza.
The fact that El Greco may have also known Cervantes, on
the other hand, is something I did not remember! remembered
until all of these pages later, when I was finally writing what I
had remembered but had not put down about El Greco earlier.
This is not really that complicated, although it may seem to be.
All it actually means is that even when one remembers some-
thing one did not remember one remembered, one may have
still no more than scratched the surface in regard to things one
does not remember one remembers.
