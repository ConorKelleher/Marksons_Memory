Although as a matter of fact I believe I did remember
Cervantes before too, even if in that case it may have only been
in connection with that castle.
Then again, perhaps it was Don Quixote I remembered,
what with the castle having been in La Mancha.
The title of the book about Don Quixote being Don Quixote
de La Mancha, of course.
Anything that El Greco and Cervantes may have said to
each other in Toledo would have been said in the same language
as the title also, presumably.
Even if El Greco may have preferred Greek. Or whatever
language they spoke on Crete, which was where he was actually
from, in fact.
This is of course assuming that even if El Greco and
Cervantes did not know each other very well, certainly they
would have at least begun to nod in passing, after a time.
And naturally next to exchange amenities.
Buenos dias, Cervantes.
Buenos dtas a usted, Theotocopoulos.
Well, and doubtless they would have exchanged similar
amenities with St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross eventually,
too.
Possibly all of this would have happened in some local shop
or other, such as the neighborhood pharmacist's, say.
Even if one doubts that either of the latter two would have
been called Saint yet, naturally.
Well, or that St. John of the Cross would have been called of
the Cross by then, either.
Buenos dfas, Saint Teresa, or, Buenos dias, John of the
Cross, surely being a little clumsy for in a drugstore in either
event.
Or for while waiting on line at the cigarette counter, certainly.
Still, all of these people always remaining just as equidistant
from each of the others as everybody in Taddeo Gaddi's studio
was, of course.
