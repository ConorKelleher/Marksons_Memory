Except that they are now undeniably equidistant from me as
well, because of being on these pages as opposed to being only
in my head.
I think.
So that even if! were to unexpectedly think about somebody
else I had not thought about for the longest time, such as, oh,
Artemisia Gentileschi, let me say, the same rule would apply.
Although something I have also just incidentally realized is
that I was probably wrong, a little while ago, when I said it was
Zeno who had proved the other rule, about the hypotenuse of a
circle.
Possibly it was Archimedes who proved that. Or Galileo.
Although what now more truthfully surprises me is that I
could have written this many pages without having mentioned
Artemisia Gentileschi to begin with.
Or that any woman artist could.
In fact Artemisia is perhaps the one person one would call
Saint at a cigarette counter or anyplace else without feeling
clumsy in the least.
So she was raped too, naturally.
At only fifteen.
But heavens, what a painter. In spite of what kind of a world
she had to face, that many years ago.
Well, in spite of even having been tortured, to test her word,
when the rape came to trial.
Although of course one of the popes made Galileo take back
every word he had said, as well.
Meantime my period and I still remain no distance at all from
each other, presumably.
Well, or the pain in my left shoulder and I, similarly.
Perhaps I have not mentioned the pain in my left shoulder.
I have mentioned it.
When I have done so up until now, however, it would have
only been as one more thing I was remembering, since I had not
actually felt it for quite some time, lately.
