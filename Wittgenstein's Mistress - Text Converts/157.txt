Which is to say it would have been still another instance of
something which existed only in my head or on the pages where
I was writing about it.
Although now it would appear to exist not only in both of
those places, but in my shoulder again also.
Even if I am perhaps somewhat perplexed as to how a pain
can exist in two other places as well as where it actually hurts.
One would appear to have just expended a great deal of effort
in verifying exactly that likelihood, however.
In either event I woke up with it this morning.
This can happen. It does not happen frequently, but it can
happen.
Basically, I believe that the pain is arthritic.
Then again, I have sometimes been tempted to connect it to
the afternoon on which I drove a Land Rover filled with picture
postcards into the Mediterranean, even though I did not believe
I had hurt myself badly at the time.
Many of the postcards in the Land Rover happened to show
reproductions of certain familiar paintings, by the way.
Mostly by Maurice Utrillo.
Somehow I have the feeling I would like to make a comment
about that, but whatever the comment is is eluding me.
Although on third thought the other question may be in no
way connected to my arthritis or to that incident near Savona
after all.
Or at least in this present instance.

strained certain muscles, yesterday.
How I might have done that was by moving the rusted lawn-
mower, when I was downstairs in the basement.
Perhaps I have not mentioned having been downstairs in the
basement.
I was downstairs in the basement. Yesterday.
Naturally I did other things besides moving the rusted lawn-
mower. One would hardly go downstairs into a basement one
