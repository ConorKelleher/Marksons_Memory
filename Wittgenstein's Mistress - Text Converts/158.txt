rarely otherwise goes into simply to move a rusted lawnmower.
Moving the lawnmower remains the most strenuous thing I
did while I was down there, however.
I did not move any of the bicycles, or the hand truck.
I believe I have mentioned that there are several bicycles in
the basement, as well as a hand truck.
There are also a number of baseballs, on a ledge.
I did not move any of the baseballs either, although I am quite
certain one would have hardly injured one's shoulder in moving
those:
In fact it was silly of me to have brought up not having moved
the baseballs.
Then again, perhaps moving the lawnmower did not really
have anything to do with anything, either.
The basement of this house is extremely damp, even at this
time of year, as I have also perhaps mentioned.
One can smell the dampness, in fact.
And to tell the truth I was down there for quite some time.
So perhaps the pain is arthritic after all, and it was the
dampness in the basement which aggravated this.
Although on yet another hand the whole business could have
actually gotten started at the spring, when I was washing my
underpants on the day before I ever even gave a thought to the
basement.
In any case one generally feels wisest in enumerating all such
possibilities where an injury is concerned.
Meanwhile the way one reaches the basement is down a

The reason I mention it now is that I would have been con-
fronting that part of the house in returning from the spring, this
doubtless having been what brought the basement into mind to
begin with.
Even if I have confronted that identical part of the house any
number of times without having thought to go down to the
