basement at all.
So that to tell the truth I have no real idea why I went down
there yesterday either, when one comes right down to it.
What I did, after I did happen to get there, was to look at the
eight or nine cartons of books.
What one does after having happened to get someplace often
having very little to do with why one may have gotten there,
however.
So that perhaps I had no reason whatsoever for having gone
to the basement yesterday.
Although I do believe I have mentioned the eight or nine
cartons of books.
These being the eight or nine cartons of books which have
more than once perplexed me by being in the basement rather
than in the house, especially since there is adequate room for
them, up here.
In fact many of the shelves up here are half empty.
Although doubtless when I say they are half empty, I should
really be saying they are half filled, since presumably they were
totally empty before somebody half filled them.
Then again it is not impossible that they were once filled
completely, becoming half empty only when somebody
removed half of the books to the basement.
I find this second possibility less likely than the first,
although it is not utterly beyond consideration.
In either event the present state of the shelves is even an
explanation for why so many of the books in the house are so
badly damaged.
Such as the life of Rupert Brooke, for instance. Or the poems
of Anna Akhmatova, or of Marina Tsvetayeva.
Perhaps if there were more books on the shelves, so that so
many of them were not standing askew, there would have been
less opportunity for the sea air to have ruined as many as it has.
The person who left the additional books in the basement
would not appear to have thought of this, however.
