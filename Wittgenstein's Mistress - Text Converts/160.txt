Still, perhaps there was some equally important reason for
the additional books having been left there.
Perhaps it was my curiosity about this very reason which
finally led me to go down to the basement yesterday to look at
the eight or nine cartons after all, in fact.
Even if I did not actually look at the eight or nine cartons of
books.
What I looked at was one of the eight or nine cartons.
Although as a matter of fact I have no idea why I keep on
speaking about eight or nine cartons, either.
There are eleven cartons of books in the basement.
One being able to make this sort of incorrect estimate in
many such situations, of course.
And which in fact will then remain in one's head for some
time even when one knows better.
Well, as I have just been illustrating.
All of the books in the basement have their own peculiar odor
of dampness, incidentally.
I have no idea how one would describe this, but it is an odor
of dampness that is peculiar to books.
Or in any event this was undeniably the case with the books
in the one carton I had opened before, which was the same one I
opened again yesterday.
Possibly I have not mentioned having opened one of the
cartons before.
One would scarcely be speaking about eleven cartons in the
basement of a house on a beach as containing books without
having opened at least one of the cartons to discover this,
however.
As a matter of fact one should have doubtless opened all
eleven of the cartons before speaking about them in that manner.
So I am still operating on the basis of very limited evidence,
actually.
Although to tell the truth the entire question has never
interested me very deeply.
