In fact moving the rusted lawnmower to open even that same
single carton again may have been little more than a way of
passing my time, yesterday.
Once I had found myself downstairs in the basement with no
reason whatsoever for finding myself there, as I have indicated.
Had I been in a different frame of mind I might have moved
the baseballs after all.
And in which instance very likely my shoulder would not feel
the way it does, either.
Actually I did look through the books this time, however,
which I had not done on the other occasion when I had opened
the carton.
Well, the other time I had not moved the lawnmower first in

With only one exception, every single one of them was in a
foreign language.
Most were in German, in fact, although not all.
The one book not in German or in another foreign language
was an edition of The Trojan Women, by Euripides, which had
been translated from Greek into English.
By Gilbert Murray.

Then again it is perhaps surprising that I did not devote more
attention to the translation after all, that being the only book
from the carton that I would have been able to read one word of.
Although actually I can read Spanish, too.
Or perhaps I should say I was once able to read Spanish, not
