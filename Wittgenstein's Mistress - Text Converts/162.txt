having tried to do so for years.
And to tell the truth I never read Spanish very well when I did
read it.
Two of the books from the carton were in Spanish.
One of these was a translation of The Way of All Flesh.
In fact I did have a certain amount of difficulty in recognizing
that one, come to think about it.
Basically, this was because the word came was used in the
title, and for some moments I kept thinking of came as meaning
meat.
Certainly The Way of All Meat did not seem like the sort of
title that anybody would give to a book.
The difficulty persisted only until I noticed that the book had
been written by Samuel Butler, however.
Naturally one would sincerely doubt that anybody one
believed had already written one book called The Way of All
Flesh would have then written another book called The Way of
All Meat.
Or that the reverse of that statement would have been very
likely true, either.
Still, I must admit that the confusion did briefly exist.
The other book in Spanish was not a translation, but had
been written in that language. This was a volume of poems by
Sor Juana Inds de la Cruz.
Well, Sor Juana Inds de la Cruz being still another person I
suspect I have mentioned.
My reason for suspecting this is that Sor Juana Inds de la
Cruz was Mexican, and I am quite positive I have spoken of
having once lived in Mexico.
Living in Mexico one would naturally have become familiar
with the names of certain Mexican poets, even if one did not
read the language they wrote in very well.
If one does not read a language very well, one generally reads
poetry in that language even less well than that, as a matter of
fact.
