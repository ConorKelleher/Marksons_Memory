[166]
Although I do believe I once did make an effort to read
certain poems by Marco Antonio Montes de Oca, even if the
chief reason I did so may have only been because of how taken I
was with his name.
Certainly it has a memorable resonance, when one says it out
loud.
Marco Antonio Montes de Oca.
Mountains of Goose being what the second half of it would
curiously appear to mean, on the other hand.
Although Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz certainly has a resonance
of its own.
Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. Sister Juana Ines of the Cross
being the translation here, obviously.
The sister part also making her a nun, of course. Even if I had
not thought of the other connection until this very instant.
Which is to say the connection between Sor Juana Ines of the
Cross and St. John of the Cross.
Well, possibly there is a connection. Then again, possibly all
sorts of people who had something to do with the Catholic
Church were called of the Cross, and it is no more than a coin-
cidence that I have suddenly been thinking about two of them.
Doubtless if I were more interested in such matters I would
have been thinking about any number of them.
For that matter I have no idea what I have been saying that
has now made me think about Artemisia Gentileschi again,
either.
Even if as I said a few pages ago I was surprised that I could
have written as many pages as I already had without having
thought about her long before that.
Well, Artemisia perhaps being the one person who, if one
could have been positive of a life after death, almost any woman
artist would have happily hanged herself to see.
Even if nobody had ever even taught her to read or write.
Or were the paintings themselves perhaps enough, if one was
Artemisia?
