Dasein, however, since it seemed to appear on practically
every page I opened to.
Martin Heidegger himself remaining somebody I know no
more about than I know about Sor Juana Inds de la Cruz, on the
other hand.
Except for now knowing that he was certainly partial to the
word Dasein, obviously.
Then again as I believe I have said one is frequently apt to
come upon a name such as Martin Heidegger's in one's reading,
even if one is scarcely apt to be reading any books by Martin
Heidegger himself.
At least this would presumably remain the case if one
happened to ever do any reading, which as I have also said I
have stopped doing.
In fact I cannot remember the last book I read, even if it may
on occasion have appeared to have been a life of Brahms.
All things considered I still do not believe it has ever been
verified that I did read a life of Brahms, however.
As a matter of fact it has only at this moment struck me that
every solitary thing I know about Brahms could have been
learned by reading the backs of the jackets on phonograph
records.
Possibly I have not mentioned reading the backs of the
jackets on phonograph records before.
It is a thing one does, however.
Well, or did, in any event, since it can now also be fairly
definitely stated that I have not read the back of the jacket on a
phonograph record for basically as many years as I have not
read a book.
In fact there are no phonograph records in this house.
Well, there is no phonograph either, when one comes down
to that.
Actually, this may have surprised me when I first came to the
house, although it is not something to which I have given any
thought since I perhaps first gave it some thought.
