gave some of that candy might very well have been Ludwig
Wittgenstein.
Perhaps I have not mentioned that one of the children to
whom Brahms now and again gave some of that candy might
very well have been Ludwig Wittgenstein.
On my honor, however, Brahms frequently visited at the
home of the Wittgenstein family, in Vienna, when Ludwig
Wittgenstein was a child. 4
So if it is a fact that Brahms was known for carrying candy in
i
his pocket to give to children when he visited people who had
children, then surely it is likely that Ludwig Wittgenstein was
one of the children he gave candy to.
Very possibly this was what was in Wittgenstein's own mind
all of those years later, in fact, when he said that you do not
need a lot of money to give a nice present, but you do need a lot
of time.
By which I mean that if the person Wittgenstein had wished
to give a present to had been a child, he could have naturally
taken care of the problem exactly the way Brahms generally
did.
Doubtless one does not stroll about Cambridge carrying
candy in one's pocket to give to Bertrand Russell or to Alfred
North Whitehead, however.
Although what one might now wish one's self is that Wittgen-
stein had been in the basement with me yesterday, so as to have
given me some help with that Dasein.
Well, or perhaps even with that other word, bricolage, that I
woke up with in my head, that morning.
a Or likewise with the whole sentence that I also must have
said to myself a hundred times, a little later on, about the world
being everything that is the case.
Surely if Wittgenstein was as intelligent as one was generally
led to believe he ought to have been able to tell me if that had
meant anything, either.
