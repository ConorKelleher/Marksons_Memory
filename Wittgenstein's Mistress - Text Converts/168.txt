was that he used to think so hard that you could actually see him
doing it.
And certainly I would have had no desire to put the man to
that sort of trouble.
Although what this for some reason now reminds me of is
that I do know one thing about Martin Heidegger after all.
I have no idea how I know it, to tell the truth, although
doubtless it is from another one of those footnotes. What I
know is that Martin Heidegger once owned a pair of boots that
had actually belonged to Vincent Van Gogh, and used to put
them on when he went for walks in the woods.
I have no doubt that this is a fact either, incidentally.
Especially since it may have been Martin Heidegger who made
the very statement I mentioned a long while ago, about anxiety
being the fundamental mood of existence.
So that what he surely would have admired about Van Gogh
to begin with would have been the way Van Gogh could make
even a pair of boots seem to have anxiety in them.
Even if there was only the smallest likelihood that a pair of
boots Van Gogh used to wear were the same pair he also once
painted a painting of, obviously.
Unless of course he had painted with only his socks on, that
day.
Or had borrowed a second pair of boots.
And on third thought it may have been Kierkegaard's boots

Actually I rarely read footnotes.
Although doubtless it is also partly age, which will some-

And by now there could well be a question of hormones too,
and of change of life.
In fact the entire story may have had something to do with
somebody sitting in one of Pascal's chairs.
And what I had really intended to have said by now was that I
was familiar with the names of the writers on certain other of the
