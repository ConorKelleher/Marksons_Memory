books from the carton as well, besides the seven by Martin
Heidegger.
Such as Johannes Keats, for instance.
Although there was also a translation of Anna Karenina in
which case it was the title itself that I was able to recognize.
This simply being because the title in German appeared to be
virtually identical with the title in English, as it happened.
But what I find interesting about this is that if the copy of that
book had been the original book itself, and had not been
translated, I would not have been able to make sense out of the
title at all.
When one says that one does not read one word of Russian
one is saying so even more truthfully than when one says that
one does not read one word of German, obviously.
In spite of practically every other word in the latter looking
like Bronte. Or Diirer.
Though there were also several items in the carton that I was
not able to identify in any way whatsoever.
By which I mean that there were certain volumes on which I
could not make sense out of the titles and did not recognize the
names of the writers either.
Doubtless none of these was a book which had been trans-
lated from English, however, where I have the largest familiarity
with writers, but had been written in German to begin with.
Which is scarcely to say that I am not familiar with certain
German writers also, on the other hand.
Certainly I am familiar with Friedrich Nietzsche, for
instance.
Well, or with Goethe.
Although by saying that I am familiar with either of these
writers I do not necessarily mean that I am extraordinarily
familiar with them.
As a matter of fact by saying that I am familiar with them I do
not even necessarily mean that I have read a solitary word that
either one of them ever wrote.
