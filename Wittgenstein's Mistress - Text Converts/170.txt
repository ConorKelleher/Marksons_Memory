Actually the sum total of that familiarity may well extend no
farther than to my reading of the backs of the jackets on
phonograph records.
Such as the back of the jacket on Thus Spake Zarathustra,
by Richard Strauss, for instance.
Or the back of the jacket on The Alto Rhapsody.
Possibly my including the back of the jacket on The Alto

Brahms had based The Alto Rhapsody on was a poem by
Goethe, however.
Neither am I forgetting The Damnation of Faust, by Berlioz,
on the other hand.
Or Gounod's Faust
Or Liszt's Faust Symphony.

any German writers by remarking that I did not recognize their
names.
Possibly any number of these writers were quite famous in
Germany and the news had simply not reached me by the time I
stopped reading.
Doubtless I would have heard of many of them within a few

did not recognize. Or Italian writers.
In fact this could have been just as true of certain writers who
wrote in Spanish.
Surely it is no more than chance that I had ever heard of Sor
