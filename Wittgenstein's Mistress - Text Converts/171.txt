1174]
Moreover even after having heard of them I might very well
have forgotten about them again entirely, if their names had not
had a certain resonance.
So perhaps it was not necessary for me to have apologized to
any German writers after all.
Franz Liszt was one more person who was in the movie Song
of Love with Bach and Clara Schumann, by the way.
I bring this up just in passing.
Well, or because of just having mentioned Liszt.
And Rainer Maria Rilke was another German writer I could
have said I was similarly familiar with, had I wished.
Although what I am really still thinking about is how you
could actually see Wittgenstein thinking, that way.
Even if thinking is what philosophers obviously do, on the
other hand.
So quite possibly the lot of them were like that. Possibly
every single philosopher from all the way back to Zeno used to
walk around letting people see that they were thinking.
Possibly they even did this when they did not have a single
thing more on their minds than the most inconsequential
perplexities, as a matter of fact.
Not that inconsequential perplexities cannot now and again
become the fundamental mood of existence too, of course.
Still, all I am suggesting is that quite possibly the only thing
that Wittgenstein himself had on his mind when people believed
he was thinking so hard may very well have been a seagull.
This would be the seagull which had come to his window
each morning to be fed, that I am speaking about. One time
when he lived near Galway Bay, in Ireland.
Possibly I have not mentioned that Wittgenstein had a pet
seagull which came to his window each morning to be fed.
Or even that he ever lived in Ireland.
Or rather what occurs to me is that I may have said it was
somebody else who had the pet seagull. And in another place
altogether.
