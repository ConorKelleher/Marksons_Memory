On my honor, it was Wittgenstein who had it. At Galway
Bay.
Wittgenstein also played an instrument, incidentally.
And sometimes did some sculpture.
I enjoy knowing both of those things about Wittgenstein.
In fact I also enjoy knowing that he once worked as a
gardener, in a monastery.
And inherited a good deal of money, but gave it all away.
In fact I believe I would have liked Wittgenstein.
Especially since what he did with the money, once he did
decide to give it away, was to arrange to have it be used to help
other writers who did not have any.
Such as Rainer Maria Rilke.
Actually, the next time I am in a town where there is a book-
store to let myself into, perhaps I will try to find something to
read by Wittgenstein after all.
Galway Bay has a much lovelier sound when one says it out
loud than when one merely looks at it on the page, by the way.
Well, doubtless it has no sound at all, when one merely looks
at it on the page.
In fact even such words as Maria Callas do not have any
sound when one is merely looking at them on the page, come to
think about it.
Or Lucia di Lammermoor.
Hm. So what color were my red roses when I typed those
words also, then?
In any case it had never crossed my mind that one might
actually name a seagull before, I do not believe.
Galway Bay. Cadiz. Lake Como. Pamplona. Lesbos.
Bordeaux.
Shostakovitch.
Oh, well. Meanwhile I have just been out to the dunes.
While I was peeing, I thought about Lawrence of Arabia.
This is scarcely to suggest that there is any particular connec-
tion between taking a pee and Lawrence of Arabia, however.
