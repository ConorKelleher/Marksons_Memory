The reason I thought about Lawrence of Arabia, as a matter
of fact, was simply because there was only one other book from
the carton that I was able to recognize, and that happened to be
a life of Lawrence of Arabia.
The reason I recognized that one, as it happened, was
because the name Lawrence of Arabia had been kept in English
in the title, in quotation marks.
Actually, I might have recognized it as a life of Lawrence of
z
Arabia at any rate, since the book also contained several
photographs of Lawrence of Arabia, but I had already made the
assumption that it was a life of Lawrence of Arabia before
noticing these.
Once I did notice the photographs I was delighted to accept
this as a verification of my assumption, however.
Lawrence of Arabia did not look very much like Peter
O'Toole, by the way, even though in some of the photographs
he was dressed like Peter O'Toole.
This would be Peter O'Toole the way he was dressed in the
film about Lawrence of Arabia, naturally.
I believe I have mentioned having seen Peter O'Toole in the
film about Lawrence of Arabia.
Although on the other hand when I say that Lawrence of
Arabia did not look very much like Peter O'Toole, I should
-r
perhaps also say that I am in no way certain of what Lawrence
of Arabia actually looked like.
Granting, I have just said it was only yesterday that I saw
certain photographs of Lawrence of Arabia.
Still, when I say that the photographs I saw yesterday were of
Lawrence of Arabia, this itself may very well be no more than
one additional assumption.
Naturally I could not make sense out of the captions that
went along with the photographs.
What I was basically basing this assumption on, therefore,
was the fact that the person in the photographs was dressed in
some of them the way Peter O'Toole was dressed in the film
