about Lawrence of Arabia.
Nonetheless one is still forced to allow for the possibility that
the photographs may not have been photographs of Lawrence
of Arabia after all.
Or even that the book itself may not have been a life of
Lawrence of Arabia.
One doubts that either of these possibilities would be particu-

Winston Churchill and T. E. Shaw are in English.
Even if it is perhaps amusing to think of Winston Churchill as

Even if on another level altogether that other name has had to
begin to trouble me again, naturally.
Or at least to the extent that after having thought about some-
body called T. E. Shaw this often I do wish that the man might
