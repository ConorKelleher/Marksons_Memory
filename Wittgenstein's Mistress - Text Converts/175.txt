have done something more that I knew about than simply
having translated the Odyssey.
Although one can now safely assume he was in some way
connected to Lawrence of Arabia also, of course.
Had his name appeared in any of the captions I might have at
least had a look at him as well, even if that would have hardly
eliminated the problem.
Each of the photographs was only of Lawrence of Arabia,
however.
Still, it undeniably does remain an interesting coincidence to
have been thinking about somebody one knows so little about
and then to have noticed his name in a book not that long after-
ward, even if one has no way of making sense out of the book in
which his name happened to be noticed.
And at least it would now appear fairly certain that he was
not a baseball player, as I had perhaps once thought.
Certainly there was no connection between Lawrence of
Arabia and baseball in the movie, at any rate.
All things considered, most likely T. E. Shaw was somebody
Lawrence of Arabia once fought with in Arabia, which I do
remember many scenes of in the movie.
Although when I say fought with, I should perhaps point out
that I mean fought on the same side as, incidentally.
Frequently when one says that somebody fought with some-
body one could just as readily mean that the person was fighting
against that person, as it happens.
So that when Marlon Brando and Benito Juarez were in
Mexico, for instance, as in another movie I once saw, one could
say that one side was fighting with the other side and mean
exactly the opposite from what one means when one says that
T. E. Shaw most likely was somebody that Lawrence of Arabia
was fighting with in Arabia.
For some curious reason one's meaning would generally
appear to be understood in such cases, however.
Naturally Lawrence of Arabia would not have been called of
