Arabia until some time after he had gotten to Arabia either, by
the way.
And what has also only now struck me is that when one is
reading certain translations in which what one keeps coming to
is a name like Rodion Romanovitch, on the other hand,
possibly one does stop and say that the name one has just come
to is not an English name after all.
Well, or when the people who do the translations make use of
peculiar spellings, as well. Such as for Klytaemnestra.
Or Elektra.
But in the meantime something I believe I may not have
indicated, when I indicated that the life of Lawrence of Arabia
was the only other book from the carton I was able to recognize,
was that it was also the last book from the carton.
Why I find this worth pointing out, as it happens, is that when
one says that a certain book was the last book from a carton,
what one almost always happens to be saying at the same time
is that it was also the first book to have been put into that carton.
And the reason for any particular book being the first book to
have been put into a carton, generally, is because it also
happens to have been the largest book among those being put in.
As a matter of fact this can practically be taken as a general
rule. Almost categorically, if the other books are put into the
carton before the largest book there will scarcely ever be any
way to fit in the largest book when one finally gets to the largest
book.
So what I actually ought to have said that I find worth point-
ing out is that I have never been able to understand this at all.
Surely there has got to be the identical amount of space in the
carton no matter which way the books go in.
Just go try putting books into a carton without putting the
largest book in first, however.
In fact now that I think about it, either Archimedes or Galileo
may have once proved something quite extraordinary in regard
to this, even if for some reason how they proved it was by
