putting books into a bathtub instead of into a carton.
Well, doubtless the reason they put the books into a bathtub
was because their own edition of the life of Lawrence of Arabia
would not fit into the carton at the end either, which would have
been what led Archimedes or Galileo to do the experiment to
begin with.
I have no idea any longer how much water one needs in the
bathtub to conduct one's own version of this experiment, on the
other hand.
Science generally being a subject one has a tendency to
forget as one gets older, unfortunately.
Conversely, what I do only this tardily come to realize is why
those eight or nine cartons of books must have been put into the
basement after all, which I believe I have said is something else
that has more than once perplexed me.
Almost certainly what must have happened was that nobody
living in the house at the time was able to make any more sense
out of most foreign languages than I myself am able to do now.
Now heavens, how weary I have gotten of looking at that
word Dasein and having no idea what it means, one can surely
imagine one of these people finally deciding.
Or, now heavens, how weary I have gotten of noticing that
silly volume which appears to be called The Way of All Meat
Downstairs they go, every last one of the troublesome things.
Granting that this would in no way explain why the transla-
tion of The Trojan Women happened to be included, although
surely this can be dismissed as an oversight.
When one comes down to it there are easier things to do than
filling eight or nine cartons with books.
Filling eleven cartons with books not being one of them, in fact.
But what this same assumption would meanwhile also
appear to solve, as it happens, is that question as to whether the
shelves in this house are to be thought of as being half empty or
half filled, which one certainly finds it agreeable to be able to
stop fretting over.
