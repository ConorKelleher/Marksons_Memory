Even if what this next reminds me of, which I have not yet
come to grips with at all, is the matter of the atlas.
Doubtless I have not even mentioned the atlas lately, to tell
the truth.
Which is not to imply that I have not been thinking about the
atlas, however.
The reason I have been thinking about it, basically, is
because of the way in which the atlas has always had to lie on its
side, which I suspect I did once point out was because of its
being too tall for the shelves.
Now naturally, there would have always been people in this
world who would have failed to make allowances for such taller
books when they were building bookshelves.
But what I am actually getting at, here, is that this very same
failure might also explain why there does not happen to be one
solitary book about art in this house, which is still one further
item I have mentioned being perplexed by.
Obviously, your ordinary book about art is quite tall.
So in fact who is to argue, now, that quite possibly there
might not have once been just as many books about art on these
shelves as there were books in foreign languages, until such
time as somebody grew exactly as weary of having a house full
of books that were forced to lie flat as he did of having a house
full of books he was not able to read?
Downstairs they go, every last one of the troublesome things.
Which is to say that quite possibly there are just as many
books about art in those cartons as there are books in German,
and all I did was open the wrong one by which to be made aware
of this.
As a matter of fact it is not even impossible that every
solitary remaining book in that basement is a book about
art.
Nor does the simple happenstance of my having found no
such books in the one carton I did open in any way eliminate
this possibility, surely.
