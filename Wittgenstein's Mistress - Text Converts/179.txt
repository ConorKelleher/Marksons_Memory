[182]
As a matter of fact I could go back down there at this very
instant and check.
Nor would I even be required to move the lawnmower again,
come to think about it, what with not having put back the lawn-
mower once I did move it.
I have no intention whatsoever of going back down there to
check.
At this very instant or at most likely any other.
And especially since I have still not even come close to
resolving the question as to why I went down there yesterday to
begin with.
Even if I did not go downstairs to the basement yesterday.
To tell the truth it has actually already gotten to be the day
after tomorrow.
Or even more probably the day after that.
Moreover it is raining.
In fact it has been raining since the morning on which I threw
out my red roses, which I did not put in either.
By either, of course, I mean also not having put in the days.
Either.
Well, I believe it was some time ago that I indicated that I
sometimes indicate them and I sometimes do not.
Possibly it began to rain on the day after the day after I went
to the basement.
On the day before the day after the day after I went to the
basement I was still typing.
I think.
In any case what I have also not put in is that the first day's
rain broke a window.
Or rather it was the wind that did that, that night.
Such things can happen.
Oh, dear, the wind has just broken one of the windows in one
of the rooms downstairs, having doubtless been all I thought.
This would have been right after I had heard the glass,
naturally.
