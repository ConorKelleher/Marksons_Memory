the least, as I started to say.
With the exception of missing my sunsets, perhaps.
Although what I have basically been doing about the rain is
ignoring it, to tell the truth.
How I do that is by walking in it.
I did not fail to notice that those last two sentences must
certainly look like a contradiction, by the way.
Even if they are no such thing.
One can very agreeably ignore a rain by walking in it.
In fact it is when one allows a rain to prevent one from
walking in it that one is failing to ignore it.
Surely by saying, dear me, I will get soaked through and
through if I walk in this rain, for instance, one is in no way
ignoring that rain.
Then again, doubtless it is rather easier to ignore it in my own
particular manner of doing so if one happens to have no clothes
on at the time.
Well, or no more than underpants.
Although as a matter of fact I stepped out of those on the
front deck each time I decided to walk, also.
Well, doubtless I had already gotten soaked while I was out
there deciding about the walk in either case.
So that by then it would have scarcely made any difference
whether I kept on my underpants or not.
Although what I am more likely admitting by all this is that I
may very well have been coincidentally aware of needing a
bath, as well. Or at least on the first of those occasions.
Normally I bathe at the spring, of course. Well, or summers
-,
as now, in any case.
Oh. And I have finally stopped staining, incidentally, which
had begun to look like forever.
And in either event it was actually an amusing diversion,
soaping myself and then walking that way until I was rinsed.
Even if for a minute I believed I had lost my stick while I was
at it.
