shake another person's hand, once he had discovered germs.
Not that a solitary other soul would believe that there were
such things, of course. Even though Galileo kept insisting he
had seen them.
In some water, I believe this was.
And they move, too, Galileo kept telling people.
Which became just as significant a moment in the history of
science as Michelangelo not going near water at all became in
the history of art, in fact.
I do not remember any longer if the water in which Galileo
found the germs was the same water in which he had proved
that the life of Lawrence of Arabia had to be put in first, on the
other hand.
And on later thought it may have been Louis Pasteur who
would never shake anybody's hand.
Or Leeuwenhoek.
What I find interesting about the possibility that it might have
been Leeuwenhoek, actually, is that Leeuwenhoek was from
Delft.
So that one of the people he would have refused to shake
hands with would have almost assuredly been Jan Vermeer.
Unfortunately the same footnote that brought up Leeuwenhoek
in connection with Delft gave no indication as to whether
Vermeer might have taken this as a slight, however.
Well, or as to how Carel Fabritius may have felt about it,
either.
Emily Bronte once painted a quite effective watercolor of
Keeper which I have actually seen a reproduction of, inciden-
tally, even if I have no idea what I have been saying that has
now made me remember this.
Any more than I have any idea what has also now made me
remember that Pascal invented the first adding machine.
Or how I even know that he did.
There goes my head again in that way that it sometimes does,
doubtless being the only explanation here as usual.
