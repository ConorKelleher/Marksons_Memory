[187]
Although one of my sunsets just before the rain was finally
another Joseph Mallord William Turner, actually.
Even if what this next reminds me of is that one more thing
that John Ruskin became famous for, besides the other thing I
have already told about that he became famous for, was
watching sunsets himself.
Although the real reason I remember this about John Ruskin
is because he actually gave his butler instructions to remind him
when it was time to look.
On my honor, John Ruskin once told his butler to announce
the sunsets.
The sunset, Mr. Ruskin, being what the butler would say.
Even if something different that has just struck me is that I
myself would appear to be saying on my honor extraordinarily
frequently, of late.
Every single time I have said it it was only because what I
had been talking about was the gospel truth, however.
Such as about Mrs. Ruskin not turning out to have had
certain superfluous material taken away by somebody like
Phidias, for instance.
Even if for the life of me I still cannot remember what I had
been trying to get that monstrosity of a canvas up that stairway
for, on the other hand.
Or whatever became of my pistol either, to tell the truth.
The pistol being the one with which I had shot holes into one
of the skylights in the museum so that the smoke from my
chimney would go out, obviously.
Well, I have just mentioned this. Or perhaps it was only
certain additional broken windows that I mentioned.
Nonetheless the last place I would seem to remember still
carrying the pistol in was Rome, for some reason.
Well, on the afternoon when I ran into that alley, in fact,
which was actually a cul-de-sac. On a street full of taverns
below the Borghese Gallery, at the intersection of Calpurnia
Avenue and Herodotus Road.
