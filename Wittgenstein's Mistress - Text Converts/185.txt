[188]
After seeing my own reflection, highlighted against a small
stretched canvas coated with gesso in the window of a shop
selling artists' supplies, as I had passed.
Still, how I nearly felt, in the midst of all that looking.
Looking in desperation, as I have said.
But too, never knowing just whom one might find, as well.
Although as a matter of fact it may very well have been
Cassandra I had intended to paint, on those forty-five square
feet.
Or should I have spelled that Kassandra, perhaps?
Even if a part I have always liked is when Orestes finally
comes back, after so many years, and Electra does not recog-
nize her own brother.
What do you want, strange man? I believe this is what
Electra says to him.
Although it is the back of the jacket on a recording of the
opera that I am thinking about now, I suspect.
Well, or because of imagining that somebody may have
actually called one's own name, do I possibly mean?
You? Can that be you? And here, of all places?
It was only the Piazza Navona, I am quite certain, so beauti-
ful in the afternoon sun, that had touched a chord.
Still, not until dusk did I emerge from the cul-de-sac.
In Italy, no less, from where all painting came.
So why would I now suddenly be thinking about certain
murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros, of all people?
And to tell the truth I also have no idea whatever became of
my thirty silent radios either, actually, that I once listened to
and listened to.
Poor Electra. To wish to murder one's own mother.
Yet everybody, in those stories. Wrist deep in it, the lot of
them.
Doubtless the radios are still in my old loft in SoHo, as a
matter of fact.
Still. So where are my seventeen wristwatches, then?
