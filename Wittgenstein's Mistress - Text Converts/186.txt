[189]
It did run on, that madness.
Walking in the rain I have not gone much farther than to
where one can see the toilet fastened to pipes on the second
floor in the house where I knocked over the kerosene lamp,
incidentally.
Even if there is no second floor.
Although what I am really remembering about that ankle
now is how astonishingly adept I became at maneuvering my
wheelchair, once I had located one.
Skittering from one end of the main floor to the other, in fact,
when the mood took me.
From the Buddhist and Hindu antiquities to the Byzantine,
or whoosh! and here we go round the icons of Andrei Roublev.
But which in turn now makes me wonder that if! am presently
hurting in two places at once, as I undeniably am, would this
then mean that I am actually hurting in four?
Except that I have now completely forgotten what the other
two places are that I might have meant, unfortunately.
Andrei Roublev was a pupil of Theophanes the Greek, by the
way. In fact he was also a sort of Russian Giotto.
Well, perhaps he was not a Giotto. Being the first great
Russian painter nonetheless, having perhaps been all one
meant.
And Herodotus was almost always spoken about as having
been the first person ever to write down any real history,
incidentally.
Even if I am not especially overjoyed at being the last.
As a matter of fact I am quite sorry I said that.
Such thoughts again being exactly the sort one would have
wished to believe one had gotten rid of with the rest of one's
baggage, naturally.
Oh, well. One can be thankful that they have been coming up
only rarely these days, at least.
Have I ever said that Turner once actually had himself lashed
to the mast of a ship, to be able to later do a painting of a storm?
