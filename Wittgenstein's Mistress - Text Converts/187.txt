Odysseus does the identical thing, of course, so that he can
listen to the Sirens singing but will stay put.
But now good heavens.
Here I sit, and it is only after all this time that I have remem-
bered the most significant thing I had meant to say about the
basement once I had started to say anything at all about the
basement.
The person who wrote that book about baseball did not make

The things one tardily becomes aware of.
Even if the whole notion actually saddens me now that I do
