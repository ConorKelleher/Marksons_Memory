finished the Unfinished Symphony, as a matter of fact, having
died at thirty-one.
And Handel can be put on the list of people who went blind, I
think.
But who was somebody named Karen Silkwood, whom I
suddenly also feel I would like to tell that you can now kneel
and drink at the Danube, or the Potomac, or the Allegheny?
And why do I only at this instant realize that Leningrad was
still called St. Petersburg when Shostakovitch was born there?
I have just wrapped my head into a towel.
Having gone out for some greens, for a wet salad, this would
be because of.
And in the meantime the more I have thought about it, the
more sorry I have gotten about what I said.
I mean about Michelangelo, not about Herodotus.
Certainly I would have found it more than agreeable to shake
Michelangelo's hand, no matter how the pope or Louis Pasteur
might have felt about this.
In fact I would have been excited just to see the hand that had
taken away superfluous material in the way that Michelangelo
had taken it away.
Actually, I would have been pleased to tell Michelangelo
how fond I am of his sentence that I once underlined, too.
Perhaps I have not mentioned having once underlined a
sentence by Michelangelo.
I once underlined a sentence by Michelangelo.
This was a sentence that Michelangelo once wrote in a letter,
when he had lived almost seventy-five years.
You will say that I am old and mad, was what Michelangelo
wrote, but I answer that there is no better way of being sane and
free from anxiety than by being mad.
On my honor, Michelangelo once wrote that.
As a matter of fact I am next to positive I would have liked
Michelangelo.
I am still feeling the typewriter, naturally. And hearing the keys.
