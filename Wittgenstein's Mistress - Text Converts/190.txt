Hm. I would seem to have left something out, just then.
Oh. All I had meant to write was that I had just closed my
eyes, obviously.
There is an explanation for my having decided to do that.
The explanation being that I would appear to be more upset
about that carton of grass that is not real than I had realized.
By which I imagine what I mean is that if the grass that is not
real is real, as it undoubtedly is, what would be the difference
between the way grass that is not real is real and the way real
grass is real, then?
For that matter what city was Dmitri Shostakovitch born in?
A certain amount of this sort of thing can actually sometimes
almost begin to worry me, to tell the truth.
Even if there would appear to be no record as to what name
Wittgenstein ever did pick out for that seagull, on the other hand.
Well, my reason for bringing this up again being because it
was a seagull that brought me to this very beach, as it happens.
High, high, against the clouds, little more than a speck, but
then swooping in the direction of the sea.
Except that the seagull was in no way a real seagull either, of
course, being only ash.
Have I mentioned looking in Savona, New York, ever? Or in
Cambridge, Massachusetts?
And that in Florence I did not let myself into the Uffizi
immediately, but lived for a period in a hotel they had named
after Fra Filippo Lippi, instead?
What I write with my stick are not necessarily always mes-
sages, by the way.
Once I wrote Helen of Troy, in Greek.
Well, or in what looked like Greek, although I was actually
only inventing that.
Even if Helen of Troy would have been only an invented
name in real Greek too, come to think about it, since it is
assuredly doubtful that anybody would have been calling her
that at the time.
