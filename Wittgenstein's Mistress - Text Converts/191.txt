[194]
I have decided to hide among some women so that I do not
have to go and fight over Helen of Troy. That hardly being the
manner in which one imagines that Achilles would have
thought about such things, for instance.
Or, I have decided to make believe I am mad and sow salt
into my fields so that I do not have to go and fight over Helen of
Troy. That hardly being the manner in which one imagines that
Odysseus would have thought about them, either.
Moreover everybody would have doubtless been too ac-
customed to calling her of Sparta to have troubled with
changing in any event.
Even after they had sailed to Troy in the one thousand, one
hundred and eighty-six ships.
Which is how many ships it says in Homer that the Greeks
sailed to Troy in, incidentally.
Even if one is personally next to positive that there would
have been no way in the world that the Greeks could have sailed
in one thousand, one hundred and eighty-six ships.
Doubtless the Greeks had twenty or thirty ships.
Well, as I believe I have mentioned, the whole of Troy being
like little more than your ordinary city block and a few stories in
height, practically.
No matter how extraordinary one may find it that young men
died there in a war that long ago and then died in the same place
three thousand years after that.
Although what one doubts even more sincerely is that Helen
would have been the cause of that war to begin with, of course.
After all, a single Spartan girl, as Walt Whitman once called
her.
Even if in The Trojan Women Euripides does let everybody
be furious at Helen.
In the Odyssey, where she has a splendid radiant dignity,
nothing of that sort is hinted at at all.
And even in the Iliad, when the war is still going on, she is
generally treated with respect.
