So unquestionably it was only later that people decided it had
been Helen's fault.
Well, Euripides of course coming much later than Homer on
his own part, for instance.
I do not remember how much later, but much later.
As a matter of fact it was as much later as twice the time
between now and when Bertrand Russell's grandfather met
George Washington, approximately.
And certainly any number of things can be lost track of, in
that many years.
So that once he had gotten the idea to write a play about the
war, certainly it would have been necessary for Euripides to
think up an interesting reason for the war.
Not knowing that the real reason must surely have been to
see who would pay tariff to whom, so as to be able to make use

more interesting reason.
Certainly writers must have now and again done this sort of
thing, one would imagine.
So that when one comes right down to it, it is equally possible

In fact if Homer had said there were only twenty or thirty
