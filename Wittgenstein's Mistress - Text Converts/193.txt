ships doubtless I would not have underlined any numbers to
begin with.
Which is to say that perhaps certain writers are sometimes
smarter than one thinks.
Then again, Rainer Maria Rilke once wrote a novel called

Except that in this instance I remember it without even

And which furthermore now makes me realize that if
Euripides had not blamed Helen for the war very possibly I

Which is to say that since Homer did not know how to write,
very possibly he did not know how to add, either.
Especially since Pascal had not even been born, yet.
But be all that as it may, what it also occurs to me to mention
