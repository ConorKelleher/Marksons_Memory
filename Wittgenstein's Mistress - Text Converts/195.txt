whole story about the two of them taking their own revenge on
Clytemnestra was another lie altogether. More than likely all
three of them together would have felt nothing except good
riddance.
Or certainly once the bathroom had been cleaned up.
And then lived happily together ever after, even.
So that as a matter of fact what I have furthermore even
suspected is that Clytemnestra would have hardly been that
much upset about the notion of the concubine after all, or at
least once she had gotten the more basic matters off her chest.
Well, or after she had also found out that the concubine

time that she kills Agamemnon.
Surely in real life she would have immediately understood
that Cassandra was mad, however, and so would have
doubtless had second thoughts on this basis alone.
How she would have immediately understood that would

started lurking at windows, naturally.
Although when I say house, I should really be saying palace,
of course.
Oh, dear, the way in which that poor child keeps lurking at
our palace windows, surely being what Clytemnestra would
have had to thint

unquestionably strengthen this entire probability.
As a matter of fact what I would now be perfectly willing to
