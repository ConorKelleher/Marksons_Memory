wager is not only that Clytemnestra and Electra and Orestes
lived happily together ever after, but that Cassandra eventually

would have nagged a little, if necessary.
Oh, now darling, what possible harm can there be in letting
her have a window or two, to lurk at?
Well, and most probably Cassandra would have brought
