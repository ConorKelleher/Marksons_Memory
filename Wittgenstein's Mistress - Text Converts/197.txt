gifts also, to smooth things over.
Trojans having been known for bearing gifts whenever they
went anyplace in either case.
Actually, a cat would have been thoughtful. Even if a cat
would have perhaps been more appropriate as a gift for Helen,
rather than for Menelaus.
I cannot remember if there is anything in the Odyssey about
Helen having a cat, however.
I say the Odyssey rather than the Iliad because of the Iliad
having been over before Cassandra would have brought the
animal, naturally.
But which again incidentally verifies that Gustave Flaubert
was wrong about a woman having written that book, since sure-
ly a woman writing it would have thought to put Helen's cat in.
In fact what does happen to be put in is a dog, belonging to
Odysseus.
Actually, the part about the dog is sad, it being the dog who is
the first to recognize Odysseus when he returns to Ithaca after
having been gone for ten extra years after Troy but then dies.
Ah, me. At least it would appear to have been some pages
since the last time I did that.
....... Or at least noticed that I did.
What I meant was hardly that it is Odysseus who dies after
returning to Ithaca, obviously. Obviously it is the dog who dies
after recognizing him.
On the other hand Penelope does not recognize Odysseus at
all, incidentally.
And which is surely additional proof about a woman not
having written that part, either.
Well, surely if a wife had been dutifully avoiding any number
of suitors for twenty full years while waiting for her husband to
come home she ought to have recognized the husband when he
got there.
Although it is the reverse of that statement which is more
likely true, actually.
