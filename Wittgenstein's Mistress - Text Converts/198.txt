Which is to say that if a woman had written that part one
sincerely doubts that the wife would have been avoiding the
suitors for all of the twenty years to begin with.
I believe I have voiced such doubts about Penelope before, as
a matter of fact.
After all.
Although come to think about it Penelope may very well
have not spent the entire twenty years at Ithaca in either case.
Or surely would have at least gone so far as to visit Helen in
Sparta herself, being a cousin.
This again being once that everybody had gotten home,
naturally.
So that her own visit would have been basically to pick up
some news, really.
Yes, yes, it is agreeable to see you again, too, Cousin Helen.
But what I am more truthfully curious about is if anybody has
heard anything of that husband of mine?
In fact it is this identical visit that her son Telemachus makes
in the Odyssey itself, come to think about it, asking about his
father.
And which is moreover the very scene in which Helen is
shown to have that splendid radiant dignity.
But be that as it may, and even if she had no news whatsoever
about Odysseus, Helen would have nonetheless had all sorts of
other interesting items to report, unquestionably.
Well, and with Ithaca being an island, especially, so that
anybody coming from there would have frequently been out of
touch altogether.
Heavens above, Penelope. Do you honestly mean to tell me
you have not even heard about my brother-in-law and the
bathtub, yet?
Then again, for all one knows Penelope's visit might very
well have coincided with Clytemnestra's own. Or certainly if
Helen had ever invited the whole family at once, say, for some
holiday or other, this could have easily been the case.
