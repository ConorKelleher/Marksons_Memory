And in which instance most likely it would have been
Clytemnestra who told Penelope about all that herself, then.
Even if she would have doubtless been discreet enough to
leave out certain parts until Electra and Orestes had left the
table, one imagines.
You don't mean it? And with a net, first? Now three cheers
for you, Cousin Cly.
Oops.
One had been forgetting something here too, obviously.
Which is to say that doubtless Clytemnestra would not have
uttered one solitary word until Menelaus had left the table,
likewise.
If for that matter Menelaus would have ever let her sit down
to begin with.
Menelaus having been Agamemnon's brother, of course.
Certain of these connections do get complicated enough to
slip one's mind like this, unfortunately.
But it does remain a fact that the two brothers had married
the two sisters.
And which would now appear to indicate that poor Electra
and Orestes would not have gotten to visit their aunt that often
after all.
Now see here, Helen. Winter solstice or not, certainly it is
pushing things a bit far to expect me to allow that woman to set
foot into this palace.
Oh, but Menelaus, darling.
Don't oh darling me. Not about this, you won't.
Even if none of this would have precluded Penelope's own
visit in any way whatsoever, on the other hand.
So that what one is now naturally forced to suspect is that
very likely it was the latter who gave Helen the cat, rather than
Cassandra who did.
Well, and doubtless it would have been exactly like Penelope
to think of an animal in any event, what with being so accus-
tomed to a dog at home.
