Although in fact she had a cat, too. Even if what I had almost
been about to forget next is that there is actually a painting
showing this, by somebody named Pintoricchio.
I am fairly certain I have mentioned the painting by
Pintoricchio showing Penelope's cat.
I am even fairly certain I have mentioned that the cat in the
painting is russet.
Even if as I have long since indicated russet is not a name one
gives to a color.
I believe it may have been Rembrandt who first established
this rule, actually, although in more recent years it was Willem
de Kooning who most strongly insisted upon it.
Then again I may have also spoken about a cat of my own as
having been russet in spite of this, now that I think back.
That would have only been carelessness, however.
And at any rate none of these cats is by any means to be
confused with Rembrandt's own cat, which I bring up only
because one might understandably think of Rembrandt's cat as
having been russet as well, if for no other reason than russet
being a color one automatically associates with Rembrandt.
Rembrandt's cat was actually gray. And had only one eye.
Which may very well be an explanation for why it always
strolled right past those gold coins on the floor of his studio
without so much as a glance, as a matter of fact, even though I
had never stopped to think about that before.
Which is to say that doubtless it had generally passed the
coins on the wrong side and so had not noticed them at all.
A good number of people also happened to disapprove of that
same cat's name, by the way, which was Argus.
There was an explanation for this, too, of course.
The explanation being that the original Argus had been a
dog.
In fact the original Argus was the very dog I have just been
talking about, and which is therefore even something of a small
coincidence, when one comes down to it.
