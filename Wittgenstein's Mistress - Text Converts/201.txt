After all, how often does one happen to be talking about the
dog who recognizes Odysseus when he finally returns to Ithaca
after having been gone for so many years but then dies? .
Or which Penelope becomes so accustomed to that it
reminds her to bring other animals as gifts, whenever she visits
anybody?
Still, people did voice disapproval over Rembrandt having
named his cat the way he did.
Now how could anybody be so foolish as to name a cat after a
dog? This basically having been the manner in which such dis-
approval was voiced.
And which brings up Carel Fabritius once again, also, if only
insofar as there would appear to be no record as to whether
Card Fabritius was one of the people involved in this or not.
One guesses that in having still been a pupil at the time he
would have very likely kept his opinion to himself, however.
Although doubtless many local merchants would have
handled the situation in much this same manner, as well.
Well, tradesmen generally being less apt than most people to
express disapproval in any event, so as not to lose patronage.
Have you heard? Rembrandt has gotten a cat that he has
named after a dog. Most probably this is approximately the
manner in which the local pharmacist would have put it, say,
insofar as such a simple statement does not necessarily have to
be interpreted as showing disapproval at all, really.
Most probably the pharmacist would have put it in just this
manner to Spinoza, in fact, on the next occasion when Spinoza
had a prescription to be filled.
Or needed cigarettes.
Then again it is equally possible that Spinoza may have
heard about the name from Rembrandt himself.
Well, as when waiting on line in the same shop, for instance,
which the two of them were frequently known to do. Certainly
as no more than casual acquaintances they would have found
this a perfectly harmless subject with which to pass the time.
