So. And have you thought up a name for your new cat yet,
Rembrandt?
As a matter of fact I am naming him Argus, Spinoza.
Ah, so you are naming your cat after the dog in the Odyssey,
are you?
One assumes that Spinoza would have answered in some-
thing like this fashion, all of this again being merely polite.
Assuredly he would have looked at the matter in a different light
later on, however.
Now how could anybody be so foolish as to name a cat after a
dog? Assuredly it would have been more in this sort of a light
that he looked at it then.
But in the meantime what is also highly probable here is that
Rembrandt himself would not have been aware of one bit of this.
Well, certainly a man facing bankruptcy would have had
little time to waste in thinking about a cat in either case.
So that doubtless as soon as the animal had been named he
would have again been preoccupied with other matters entirely.
Such as finishing The Night Watch, for instance.
Interestingly, by the way, I had never understood what it was
supposed to be about The Night Watch at all, when I had only
seen reproductions of it.
When I finally walked into the Tate Gallery in London and
saw the canvas itself it sent shivers up and down my spine,
however.
As if there were a glow from inside of the pigments them-
selves, practically.
So that I was even more careful with it than with any other
painting I had ever removed to make use of the frame from, I
suspect.
And especially when I was nailing it back into place.
Even though my fire had almost gone out before I was
finished, too, as I remember.
To this day I have never quite been able to solve how
Rembrandt managed to bring that off, either.
