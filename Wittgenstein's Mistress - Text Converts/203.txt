Well, which is why he was Rembrandt, presumably.
Have I ever said that my pickup truck has English license
plates and a right-hand drive, incidentally?
Heaven only knows what it was doing parked at one of the
marinas here. But I have been driving it locally ever since.
Although there is one more thing I had wished to point out
about that question of Rembrandt's cat before I leave it,
actually.
Which is the way in which so many more people happened to
be familiar with the writings of Homer in those days than would
have been the case later on.
Here we have Carel Fabritius and the pharmacist and
Spinoza, all immediately recognizing the name of the dog.
Well, and not to mention Rembrandt himself, who chose it.
But for that matter doubtless Jan Vermeer would have
recognized it just as quickly, once he in turn became a pupil of
Carel Fabritius and Carel Fabritius was explaining about
russet and bedspreads.
Well, and as would Leeuwenhoek and Galileo, doubtless,
having been in Delft, too.
Conversely if I had named my own russet cat Argus I am
next to positive that not one solitary person I knew would have
made the connection with Odysseus's dog at all.
As a matter of fact the only individual I can recall personally
who ever did make this connection was Martin Heidegger.
I have perhaps said that badly.
In saying that I can personally recall Martin Heidegger
having made this connection very likely what I have implied is
that I once spoke with Martin Heidegger.
Martin Heidegger is not somebody I once spoke with.
As a matter of fact another implication in that same sentence
would presumably be that I might have understood such a
conversation if it had occurred.
Which I would not have, obviously, not speaking one word of
German.
