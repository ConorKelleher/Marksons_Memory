Not that it is of course impossible that Martin Heidegger spoke
English on his own part, although I did not ask him that, either.
Ah, me.
Possibly I had better start over.
I am starting over.
What happened was that I once wrote Martin Heidegger a
letter.
It was in answer to my letter that Martin Heidegger indicated
his familiarity with the Odyssey.
Even though my own letter had had nothing to do with that
topic.
Although in fact what I now believe is that I wish to start this
whole thing still one more time.
I am starting this whole thing still one more time.
What really happened, once, was that I wrote letters to a
considerable number of famous people.
So that to tell the truth Martin Heidegger was not even the
most famous person I wrote to.
Certainly Winston Churchill would have been considered
more famous than Martin Heidegger.
In fact I am positive that Picasso would have also been
considered more famous than Martin Heidegger.
And that the same thing could have assuredly been said
about the Queen of England.
Well, and what with fame generally being a matter of one's
orientation anyway, surely in the eyes of people who admired
music Igor Stravinsky and Maria Callas would have been said
to have been more famous themselves.
As no doubt in the eyes of people who admired movies this
would have held true for Katharine Hepburn or Marlon Brando
or Peter O'Toole.
Or as for people who admired baseball it might even have
appeared to be the case with Stan Usual.
But be all that as it may! wrote letters to every single one of
these people.
