And as a matter of fact I wrote letters to more people than
this.
Some of the other people I suspect I may also have written to
were Bertrand Russell, and Dmitri Shostakovitch, and Ralph
Hodgson, and Anna Akhmatova, and Maurice Utrillo, and
Irene Papas.
Moreover I suspect I may have even written to Gilbert
Murray and to T. E. Shaw.
Although when I say I suspect in regard to these latter cases
it is because with a good number of them I can no longer be
certain.
The chief reason I can no longer be certain being simply that
I wrote all of these letters a good many years ago.
But too, another reason is that a certain number of the people
I have mentioned may in fact have already been dead by the
time I wrote the letters.
And in which case I would have scarcely written to them,
naturally.
Well, this having been the very situation with such people as
Jackson Pollock, and Gertrude Stein, and Dylan Thomas, to
whom I naturally did not write, either.
So that all I actually mean is that after so long I have
forgotten a lot of these other people's dates.
Which is to say that even though I happen to be thinking
about them now as having been people I might have thought
about writing to then, they may have obviously not been people
I would have been thinking about writing to then after all.
This is not really that complicated, although it may seem to be.
And to tell the truth I had no special messages for anybody
individually in any case.
Every single one of the letters having been identical.
In fact they were all Xerox copies of one letter.
All of them stating that! had just gotten a cat.
Well, naturally the letters stated more than that.
One would hardly sit down and Xerox a letter to Picasso, or
