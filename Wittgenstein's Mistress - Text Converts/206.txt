to the Queen of England, simply to state that one had just gotten
a cat.
It being that I was having an extraordinary amount of dif-

certain people at my studio, one evening, and one of these
people happened to ask me what my almost cat's name
happened to be.
Well, visiting at somebody's studio and having an almost cat
