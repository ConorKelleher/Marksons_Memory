writing to then, he may have actually not been somebody I
would have happened to think about writing to then.
In all instances lately when I have spoken about my studio,
by the way, I have also been speaking about my loft.
Having worked where I lived, if I have not made that clear.
Well, or vice versa.
Although in the meantime I have only at this instant been
struck by something quite curious.
In fact it is extraordinarily curious.
Not sixty seconds ago I walked into the kitchen for a drink of
water, from my pitcher.
While I was walking back I heard part of one of the
Bachianas Brasileiras, by Villa -Lobos, in my head.
I mean the one that everybody was generally familiar with,
with the soprano voice.
Still, the Bachianas Brasileiras by Villa -Lobos being some-
thing else I am next to positive I have never mentioned before,
either.
Even though what I realized simultaneously is that I have
heard that identical piece of music now and again whether I
have mentioned it or not.
In fact I have heard it as many times as I have thought about
Magritte, practically.
Except that every single time I have heard it what I have
always said to myself I was hearing was The Alto Rhapsody.
And which obviously now implies that every single time I
have mentioned The Alto Rhapsody what I ought to have
mentioned was one of the Bachianas Brasileiras.
And moreover that every single time I have mentioned
Kathleen Ferrier singing the Brahms what I ought to have
mentioned was Bidti Sayao singing the Villa -Lobos.
Even if it may have been Kirsten Flagstad singing.
And in a manner of speaking I was not really hearing any one
of the three to begin with.
Hm.
