certainly at least in terms of having saved the expense.
What with only one of the people to whom I had sent the
letters ever taking the trouble to return the postcard in either
case.
This having been Martin Heidegger.
And who in fact spoke quite impressive English after all.
Even making use of the subjunctive, as it happened.
Although when I say spoke, I should really be saying wrote,
of course.
What I should wish to suggest as a name for your dog is the
splendid classical name of Argos from the Odyssey by Homer,
having been what was written in English on the postcard from
Martin Heidegger.
For some period I was fairly annoyed with Martin Heidegger.
Well.
Even if I did finally come to realize that doubtless philoso-
phers had more important items on their minds than names for
other people's pets.
Ach, here I sit with such important items as Dasein on my
mind, surely being what Martin Heidegger must have said to
himself, and there is that person in America requesting a name
for her foolish animal.
So that in the final analysis it was actually quite kind of
Martin Heidegger to have taken the time to write at all, in spite
of having made a mistake when he did so.
And even though it had taken almost seven months before the
postcard came back, additionally.
But which may have also very well been the reason for Martin
Heidegger's mistake, now that one stops to think about it.
Which is to say that very possibly Martin Heidegger was
busily writing one of his books through all of that time.
Very possibly the book he was so busily writing was one of
the very books in the carton in the basement of this house, in
fact, and which only goes to show how astonishingly small the
world can be.
