But in either case not until Martin Heidegger had finished
writing his book would he have found my letter again.
Or rather what he more likely would have found was only the
postcard, having doubtless discarded the letter as soon as he
had read it.
Certainly having had no doubts at all that he would remember
what he was supposed to write on the card.
Well, and being a famous philosopher having had even fewer
doubts that he would remember the difference between a cat
and a dog, surely.
Unless on second thought there is a subtle possibility here
that Martin Heidegger did not make a mistake after all?
Granting that this has only this tardily come into my head.
But still, why couldn't Martin Heidegger have perhaps known
that whole story about Rembrandt and his own cat?
And why couldn't Susan Sontag have indicated while she
was dictating my letter that I was a painter myself?
Surely in writing to total strangers one would have shown the
courtesy to identify one's self in either event.
So that what would have really gone through Martin Heideg-
ger's mind, then, would have been something like, ach, so what
I will tell this painter person in this SoHo place to name her
animal is what Rembrandt named his.
And which would thus call for a rather different explanation
as to why Martin Heidegger still happened to write dog instead
of cat, obviously.
The rather different explanation being obviously that Martin
Heidegger's English was hardly so impressive as one had
thought.
Still, what I am finally almost sorry about is that I never did
write to Martin Heidegger a second time, to thank him.
Well, and I certainly would have found it agreeable to tell the
man how fond I am of his sentence, too, about inconsequential
perplexities now and again becoming the fundamental mood of
existence.
