Unless as I have said it may have been Friedrich Nietzsche
who wrote that sentence.
Or Soren Kierkegaard.
And even if! had long since given the cat itself another name
altogether, of course.
Hm.
Except that after all of this talk I suddenly cannot seem to
remember what name I did give it.
Doubtless this is only because I have been speaking about so
many other cats, however.
Not even counting Rembrandt's, for instance, there is the cat
that Medea gave to Helen, and there is the cat I saw in the
Colosseum, and there is the cat which scratches at the outside
of my window, here.
Well, and then there are all of those cats which would have
been leery about going to the garbage disposal area because of
so many seagulls doing their scavenging, and there is the cat
which Taddeo Gaddi once did a painting of and was speaking
about as being russet until Giotto informed him it was burnt
sienna.
Which Theophanes the Greek had informed Giotto before
that.
I believe that cats may have been mentioned in connection
with such people as Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and Ludwig
Wittgenstein and Anna Karenina in some way or other, as well.
Then again I may be in error about Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz,
not knowing whether anybody who lived in a convent was
permitted to have a cat.
I am assuming that Sister Joan Inez of the Cross lived in a
convent.
But which is to say that St. Teresa would not have had a cat in
Toledo either, then.
Well, and I now realize I am in error about Ludwig Wittgen-
stein, too, since any cat of Wittgenstein's would have been just
as leery about his own pet seagull as were all of those other cats
