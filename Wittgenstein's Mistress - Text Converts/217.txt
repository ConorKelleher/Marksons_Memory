paintings Van Gogh painted while wearing the old socks that
Alfred North Whitehead later used to put on when he went for
walks in the woods near Cambridge, on the other hand.
Although another thing I have perhaps never mentioned is
that Ludwig Wittgenstein actually used to carry sugar in his
pockets, when he went for walks near Cambridge himself.
The reason he carried the sugar being to give it to horses he
might see in fields while he was walking.
On my honor, Wittgenstein used to do that.
For some reason this story is another that reminds me of
something, even if I have no idea what, at the moment.
Doubtless I will think of my cat's name in a day or two also,
however.
And in the meantime what I have just decided to do is to
change the name of the cat which scratches at the outside of my
window.
What I am now calling that cat is Magritte.
Well, Magritte having more of a connection with a cat that is
not really a cat than Van Gogh does, being all.
Even if the very painting by Van Gogh I have just mentioned
is a painting of a fire which is not really a fire but is only a
reflection of a fire, actually.
And which perhaps I have never even seen except in a repro-
duction either, since on second thought I do not remember it at
the Uffizi after all.
Wittgenstein was never married, by the way: Well, or never
had a mistress either, having been a homosexual.
Although in the meantime when I just said in the meantime I
truly did mean in the meantime.
It now being almost an entire week since I additionally said I
would doubtless think of my cat's name in a day or two.
And this in turn being by far the longest period I have allowed
to go by without sitting at the typewriter.
My shoulder and my ankle no longer hurting as badly as they
did, however.
