Which is not to say that the pains in my shoulder or my ankle
had anything to do with my not sitting at the typewriter.
Or that the pains no longer being as bad as they were has
anything to do with my being back.
For some reason all I felt like doing was lying in the sun, for a
time.
Which is also to say that it has stopped raining, obviously.
Well, one hardly having been able to lie in the sun if it hadn't.
Obviously.
In fact I have been having some rosy -fingered dawns again
after all, too.
Even if how I happened to feel through most of the week was
depressed, to tell the truth.
I believe I have said that I felt depressed at least once before,
actually, while writing these pages.
Although perhaps what I more exactly said I felt once before
was a certain undefined anxiety.
Which in that instance would have only been because of my
period coming on, however.
Or because of hormones.
And so which would have not really been anxiety at all, but
only an illusion.
Even if one would certainly be hard put to explain the dif-
ference between an illusion of anxiety and anxiety itself.
And in either case how I still felt this time was depressed.
Even if I had no idea why.
And moreover even if feeling depressed and having no idea
why can generally leave one feeling even more depressed than that.
I was fairly certain that none of it had anything to do with not
being able to remember the name of my cat.
Well, and too, once the rain had stopped but the woods were
still wet everything was extraordinarily beautiful, and all of the
wet leaves glistened and glistened.
So that it scarcely could have had anything to do with the
rain, either.
