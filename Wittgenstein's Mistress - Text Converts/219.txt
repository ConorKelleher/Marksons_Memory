Which I had been finding agreeable to ignore by walking in it
in any event.
Finally on Tuesday I understood why I was feeling depressed.
Which was the same day on which I noticed that my rowboat
would have to be bailed out, incidentally, should I wish to make
use of my rowboat.
Although when I say this was Tuesday I am saying so only in
a manner of speaking, naturally.
Having had no idea what day of the week it has ever been
through any of these years, of course, and which is surely
another thing I must have mentioned.
Still, certain days feeling like Tuesday, for all that.
And even if! could also not remember having ever bailed out
my other rowboat at all, although certainly I must have done so,
now and again.
Unless it had never once rained while I still had my other
rowboat.
Or I had never had another rowboat.
Certainly I once had another rowboat.
Just as I once had another cat, in fact, besides the cat I once
wrote letters to all of those famous people about, and which was
why I was feeling depressed.
This having been a cat before that cat, and which I had com-
pletely forgotten about when I was doing that list of so many
other cats, last week.
In fact! suspect there is something ironical in my having
been able to remember Helen of Sparta's cat, or even Carel
Fabritius's burnt sienna cat, and not remembering this partic-
ular cat.
Especially since this particular cat was not really mine but
was Lucien's.
And even though! had a husband at the same time, named
Adam, whom I do not remember very frequently, either.
What happened with this cat having been that Adam and I
suggested to Lucien that he should be the one to give it its name.
