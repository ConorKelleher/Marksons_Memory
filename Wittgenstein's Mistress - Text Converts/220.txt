And which Lucien then commenced to look upon as an
extraordinary responsibility.
Well, being only four, doubtless he had never had a responsi-
bility before whether extraordinary or not.
So that for a certain period all that Lucien ever appeared to
be doing was fretting over a name for the cat.
And which in the meantime we called simply Cat.
Good morning, Cat, being what I would say when I found the
cat waiting for breakfast.
Good night, Cat, being what either Adam or I would say
when we put the cat out for the night.
All of this having taken place in Mexico, incidentally, in a
village not far from Oaxaca.
And naturally in a village in Mexico one puts one's cat out for
the night.
Well, the village scarcely needing to be in Mexico for one to
do that in either, of course.
Later, in fact, I remember having done the identical thing
with my Martin Heidegger cat, once when I was painting in
Rome, New York, for a summer.
Although in that instance with the cat having been a city cat!
did worry to some degree, perhaps.
Even if a cat which had been locked up in a loft in SoHo for
all of its life ought to have found it agreeable to be outside at
night, surely.
But be that as it may, Lucien never did seem to decide upon a
name for that earlier cat.
Or for so long that very likely it would have been impossible
to stop calling it simply Cat by then in either case.
Although as a matter of fact we had taken to calling the cat
Cat in Spanish too, sometimes.
Buenos dias, Gato, being what I would sometimes say when
I found the cat waiting for breakfast.
Buenas noches, Gato, being what Adam or! would some-
times say when we put the cat out for the night.
