[224]
For three years we called the cat that, either Gato or Cat, and
then I went away from the village not far from Oaxaca.
Even though I did go back, once, years and years afterwards,
as I have possibly said.
And in a Jeep was able to maneuver directly up the hillside to
where the grave was, instead of being forced to follow the road.
Having still been making use of all sorts of vehicles, in those
days.
Well, having still been looking, in those days.
If having been quite mad for a good deal of the time, too, of
course.
Mexico having appeared as reasonable a place in which to
begin to look as any, however, whether I was mad or not.
Even if I am convinced that I remained in New York for at
least two winters before I did look elsewhere, actually.
And even if one surely does not have to be mad in the least, in
being drawn to the grave of one's only child.
So that when one truly comes down to it perhaps I was only
partly mad.
Or mad only part of the time.
And able to understand that Lucien would have been almost
twenty by then at any rate, and so well on his way to becoming a
stranger.
Well, or perhaps not yet quite twenty.
And perhaps not at all on his way to becoming a stranger.
There being certain things that one will never ever know, and
can never ever even guess at.
Such as why I spilled gasoline all over his old room on that
very next morning, for that matter.
After turning my shoes upside down, naturally, in case of
scorpions, even though there could no longer have been any
scorpions.
And then watched the image of the smoke rising and rising in
my rearview mirror as I drove and drove again.
Across the wide Mississippi.
