one's husband had become drunk.
Doubtless it may have been a good deal of both, on the other
hand.
Most things generally being, a good deal of both.
And none of what I have just written having been what really
happened in either event.
Since both of us were there, that weekend.
And could do nothing about anything, was all.
Because they move, too, Pasteur kept telling people.
Except later to make even more out of such guilts as one
already possessed, of course.
And life did go on.
Even if one sometimes appeared to spend much of it looking
in and out of windows.
Or with nobody paying attention to a word one ever said.
Although one continued to take still other lovers, naturally.
And then to separate from other lovers.
Leaves having blown in, or fluffy cottonwood seeds.
Or then again one sometimes merely nicked, too, with
whomever.
Time out of mind.
While next it was one's mother who died, and then one's
father.
And one even took away the tiny, pocket sort of mirror from
beside one's beautiful mother's bed, in which she and her image
had both been equidistant from what lay ahead.
Although perhaps it was one's father, who had no longer
wished her to perceive that distance.
Even if! have seen my mother's image in my own, in the one
mirror in this house as well, incidentally.
On each of those occasions having always made the assump-
tion that such illusions are quite ordinary, however, and come
with age.
Which is to say that they are not even illusions, heredity
being heredity.
