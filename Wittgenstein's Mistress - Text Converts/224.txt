Then again having never painted any sort of portrait of poor
Lucien at all, on the other hand.
Though there is the framed snapshot of him in the drawer
beside my own bed upstairs, of course.
Kneeling to pet Ga to.
And he is obviously in my head.
But then what is there that is not in my head?
So that it is like a bloody museum, sometimes.
Or as if I have been appointed the curator of all the world.
Well, as I was, as in a manner of speaking I undeniably am.
Even if every artifact in it ought to have made me even more
surprised than I turned out to be at not having thought about
Magritte until I did, actually.
And so that even the very marker that Adam had promised to
place beside the grave when I did not stay on for that had been
in my head for all of those years before I went back, as well.
Without there ever having been a marker.
God, the things men used to do.
What do any of us ever truly know, however?
And at least as I started to say I certainly did finally under-
stand what it was that had made me feel depressed.
Last Tuesday.
When all I had been doing was lying in the sun after the rain
had stopped and thinking about cats, or so I believed.
Although to tell the truth I do not very frequently allow such
things to happen.
By which I hardly mean thinking about cats.
What I am talking about is thinking about things from as long
ago as before I was alone, obviously.
Even lone can hardly control one's thinking in such a way as
not to allow anything that happened more than ten years ago to
come into it.
Certainly I have thought about Lucien before, for instance.
Or about certain of my lovers, like Simon or Vincent or
Ludwig or Terry.
