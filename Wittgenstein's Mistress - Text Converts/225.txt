Or even about as early as the seventh grade when I almost
wanted to cry because I knew, knew, that Odysseus's dog could
certainly catch that tortoise.
Well, and doubtless I have thought about the time when my
mother was asleep and I did not wish to wake her and so wrote I
love you with my lipstick on that same tiny mirror, as well.
Having intended to sign it Artemisia, except that I ran out of
MOM.
You will never know how much it has meant to me that you
are an artist, Helen, my mother having said, the very afternoon
before.
But the truth of the matter being that I did not intend to repeat
one bit of that just now, actually.
In fact when I finally did solve why I had been feeling de-
pressed what I told myself was that if necessary I would simply
never again allow myself to put down any of such things at all.
As if in a manner of speaking one were no longer able to
speak one solitary word of Long Ago.
So that even if it were not until right at this instant that I were
to first remember having written to Jacques Levi -Strauss, say, I
would no longer put something like that down, likewise.
One scarcely having been able to write to Jacques Levi-
Strauss or to any single other person unless it had been before
one was alone, obviously.
Any more than Willem de Kooning could have been at one's
studio to dictate such letters to begin with.
Or Robert Rauschenberg could have been there to correct
their mistakes.
Or its, since there was really only the one letter.
With Xerox copies.
To all of those additional people.
Who were obviously still someplace, too.
Except that what I also realized in making such a decision
was that it would certainly leave me with very little else to write
about.
