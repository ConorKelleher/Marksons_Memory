Especially if even in writing about such harmless items as
pets I could still wind up thinking about meningitis, for
instance. Or cancer.
Or at any rate feeling the way I did.
So that what I realized almost simultaneously, in fact, was
that quite possibly I might have to start right from the beginning
and write something different altogether.
Such as a novel, say.
Although there is perhaps an implication in those few
sentences that I did not intend.
Well, which is to say that people who write novels only write
them when they have very little else to write.
Any number of people who write novels no doubt taking their
work quite seriously, in fact.
Although when I say write or taking, I should really be saying
wrote or having taken, naturally.
Well, as I have only just explained.
But in either case doubtless when Dostoievski was writing
about Rainer Maria Raskolnikov he took Rainer Maria
Raskolnikov quite seriously.
Well, or as Lawrence of Arabia undeniably did when he was
writing about Don Quixote.
Or just look at how many people might have gone through life
believing that castles in Damascus was just a phrase, for instance.
Still, what happened next was that I realized just as quickly
that writing a novel would not be the answer anyhow.
Or certainly not when your ordinary novel is basically
expected to be about people too, obviously.
And which is to say about certainly a good number more
people than just one, also.
In fact without ever having read one word of that same novel
by Dostoievski I would readily be willing to wager that Rainer
Maria Raskolnikov is hardly the only person in it.
Or that Anna Akhmatova is the only person in Anna
Karenina, as well.
