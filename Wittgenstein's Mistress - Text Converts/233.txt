more often than not.
And of course without even thinking about that Wednesday
or Thursday morning, this is.
Even if for the life of me I have no idea why I am talking
about one bit of that now, either. Any of it.
When all I had actually been about to say was that I have no
real explanation for not having written anything in these past
seven or eight weeks.
Even if I have already listed several, such as going for
supplies, or devoting more time than usual to my dismantling.
Although another reason may very well be that I have
appeared to be frequently tired lately, to tell the truth.
As a matter of fact what I ought to have perhaps just said was
not that I have no explanation for not having written anything in
the past seven or eight weeks, but for having been so frequently
tired during that period.
In fact I am feeling tired right at this moment.
Perhaps I was feeling tired when! spent that week lying in the
sun before I last did do any writing, too, now that I stop to think
about it.
So that I am less than positive that I have brought in as many
items for winter as I will need after all, actually.
Or that! have done nearly as much dismantling as is neces-
sary, either.
Especially since any number of the boards are still waiting to
be sawed, as it happens.
Although I have never considered sawing the boards to be
part of the process of dismantling, incidentally.
Being rather a question of turning dismantled lumber into
firewood.
After it has been dismantled.
Even if such a distinction is doubtless no more than one of
semantics.
And in either case perhaps I will do some more of that, later
today.
