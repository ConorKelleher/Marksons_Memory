Perhaps I will find the painting I have lost later today, also.
Although doubtless I have not mentioned that I have lost a
painting.
Well, assuredly I have not mentioned having lost it, what
with not having written one solitary word since some time
before that happened.
It being the painting of this very house, that I am talking
about, and which until at least last August had been hanging

rooms to which the doors are likewise generally closed.
As a matter of fact I have also walked to the house in the
woods behind this house, suspecting that I might have been
mistaken as to the whereabouts of all three items, but the
