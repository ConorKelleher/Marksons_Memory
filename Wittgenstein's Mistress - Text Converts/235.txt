painting and the life of Brahms and the atlas do not appear to be
in that house, either.
In fact the only item in that house which I remembered
having ever given even a second glance, in addition to a repro-
duction of a painting by Suzanne Valadon that is taped to the
living room wall, was a soccer shirt with the name Savona
printed across its front.
Which I have now washed at the spring and am wearing as I
type.
As a matter of fact I have been wearing the soccer shirt for
some days.
Even if I have no idea what it is, really, about wearing the
soccer shirt.
And even if! am still at a total loss in regard to that painting.
Which I may or may not have painted myself, incidentally, if
I have not said.
Actually I have no recollection whatsoever of having painted
that painting.
Still, ever since it turned up missing I have had the curious
impression that I just could have.
Or at least that I certainly once imagined it as a painting that I
might possibly paint but then did not.
Which is the sort of thing that a painter will now and again
do, of course.
Or not do, rather.
But in which instance there could have scarcely been a
painting for me to have lost after all, obviously.
Or would that have to mean that there might have been no life
of Brahms and no atlas either, then?
Except that if there had not been any atlas how could I have
once looked up Lititz, Pennsylvania, in it, on an occasion when
I happened to be curious about Lititz, Pennsylvania?
And if there had not been any life of Brahms how could I have
once lighted some torn -out pages from it on the beach and then
tossed them into the air to see if the breeze might make them fly?
