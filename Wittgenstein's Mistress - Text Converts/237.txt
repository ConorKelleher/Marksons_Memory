Well, that certainly being a harmless enough thing to make
believe.
Oh. And I have been hearing The Alto Rhapsody again also,
these days.
Which is to say the real Alto Rhapsody this time, what with
all of that having finally been sorted out.
Even if it is still hardly the real one either, naturally, being
still only in my head.
But still.
And at any rate it is far too chilly this morning to be fretting
about inconsequential perplexities of that sort.
In fact it is far too chilly to be typing here to begin with,
actually.
Unless I might wish to move the typewriter closer to my pot-
bellied stove, some way.
Although what I really ought to do before doing that is to go
out to the spring again, to tell the truth.
Having completely forgotten about the rest of my laundry,
which is spread across various bushes.
• So that by now there could very well be some new skirt
sculptures out there, even.
Even if Michelangelo would not think them that, but I think
them that.
And even if! will more probably leave the rest of the laundry
where it is until I am feeling less tired, on the other hand.
Doubtless I will not trouble to move the typewriter, either,
when one comes down to that.
Once, I had a dream of fame.
Generally, even then, I was lonely.
To the castle, a sign must have said.
Somebody is living on this beach.
