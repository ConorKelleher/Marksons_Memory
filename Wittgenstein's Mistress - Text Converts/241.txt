woman named Kate who seems to be the last person on earth.
And yet it has the greatest amount of intellectual activity, being
(at this level) one of the most profound investigations of episte-
mology in literature and the best fictional illustration I know of
Wittgenstein's proposition that "Philosophy is a battle against
the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language."
Like all of Markson's protagonists, Kate views the world
through the lenses of culture: "one does not spend any time
viewing castles in La Mancha without being reminded of Don
Quixote," she writes. "Any more than one can spend time in
Toledo without being reminded of El Greco" (39). And like
both Fern in Markson's novel Going Down (1970) and Lucien
in Springer's Progress (1977), Kate has a huge fund of anec-
dotal material on painters, supplemented by a general knowl-
edge of writers, composers, singers, and philosophers—often
the kind of material (as Kate is the first to admit) that one picks
up from such places as the liner notes on record albums, dust-
jacket copy, or digressive footnotes in biographies. Kate can't
remember where she learned many of these items—like the fact
manuscripts of Sappho's poems were once used to stuff mum-
mies—nor why such trivia has stayed with her all these years
while more substantial matters have slipped her mind. Nor does
she always remember such trivia correctly, and it is here that
Markson's use of intertextuality differs most not only from his
earlier work but from that of other allusive writers.
0-- For earlier writers (and in Markson's earlier works), culture
was stable and objective, an orderly accumulation of facts—

names, dates, compositions, critical opinions—that could be

called up by the writer (and/or his characters) as in a user-
friendly data -retrieval system. In Wittgenstein's Mistress, how-
ever, culture is unstable and subjective, a fading memory of
"baggage" that teases Kate with false connections, "inconse-
quential perplexities," and meaningless coincidences. It is a
disorderly jumble where Euripides seems to have been influ-
enced by Shakespeare, where Anna Akhmatova is a character in
