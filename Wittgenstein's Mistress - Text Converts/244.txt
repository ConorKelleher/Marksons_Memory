[248]
And for that matter poor Bach's widow Anna Magdalena, who was
allowed to do the same thing....
Ah, me. If not to add poor Andrea del Sarto and poor Cassandra
and poor Marina Tsvetayeva and poor Vincent Van Gogh and poor
Jeanne Hebuterne and poor Piero di Cosimo and poor Iphigenia and
poor Stan Gehrig and poor singing birds sweet and poor Medea's little
boys and poor Spinoza's spiders and poor Astyanax and poor my aunt
Esther as well....
So for that matter poor practically the whole world then, more of-
ten than not. (234-36)
This outpouring of sympathy seems to have a cathartic effect
on Kate, however. Nearly two months have passed since she
broke off typing the book we are reading, and some sense of
balance and renewal seems to have come to her in the mean-
time. After the first snow falls, she is reminded of "that old lost
nine -foot canvas of mine, with its opaque four white coats of
gesso. / Making it almost as if one could have newly painted the
entire world one's self, and in any manner one wished" (233).
She seems to be doing just that at novel's end, building fires
on the beach after sunset and making believe they are Greek
watchfires at Troy, starting over again where it all began. Like
the woman in the hypothetical novel Kate toys with writing
(a metafictional version of Wittgenstein's Mistress itself, obvi-
ously), Kate has "gotten more accustomed to a world without
any people in it than she ever could have gotten to a world with-
out such a thing as The Descent from the Cross, by Rogier van
der Weyden, ... Or without the Iliad' (232-33). The throat-
constricting desolation of the novel's final lines seven pages
later discourages the reader from too cheery an interpretation,
but civilization seems finally to have been worth it after all. At
any rate, I now couldn't become accustomed to a world without
Wittgenstein's Mistress.
